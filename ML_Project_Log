Log of Roybot project:

- Ran out of memory
- Only need bordering messages, not entire message chunks
- Ran out of memory

- Processed out all non-ascii text
- Changed numpy dType to Boolean, since all data is one-hot encoded



- Used build data to generate text files of various character lengths in order to control difficulty of training.

- Found very small improvement with lower character length

- Old fra-eng translation code somehow works tho, look into this

- Next step: use word embeddings

- Also downloaded a shit ton of more dat

- Things to do:
	- Train lstm.py on 20 char data
	- Train lstm.py on 20 char big data
	- Train train_rnn.py on 20 char big data
