i think u should firing it on friday, and whoever interested in helping u build it, tell them then about building process	kk
have u tested it picking up different objects?	the claw it self yeah
ok sounds awesome!	what do you think about the sandpaper idea though?
hmm i dont k what u mean by stabilizing the base with sandpaper	by adding sandpaper to the bottom of the base
i see, ya that should work	i won't get sued for property damage?
(techincaly today)	cya!

next yr. we will destroy acton 	when is that mit thing due/find out more about it?
just waiting to get back emails	ooh ic ic
tho don't thank me too soon, i don't k if they will allow it yet	hmm idk what to do over the summer tbh
idk	tbh i don't really understand all the planning and penalties. it feels like psuedo work, why not just dive into actual work, then just tell each other
i'm kinda tired of this	nah it's ok, i was just coding during this so everything be all goooood
roy question	yes?
just online? or did u take a class	just by myself
dang thats impressive yo	nah man, just piecing together what i've done before
leadership charisma = im excited while bossy at the same time	idk man, when you become a big name ceo i'll be the first to jump into r&d for you
pshh when u become a big name inventor ill jump into ur marketing team	thx man thx
trakimas :'(	lol, idk man you are probably one of the most hardworking ppl i know
dang	ok backkk
also i want to try to learn that kinda thing so i can like actually do projects	hmm
just eclipse	just for java i'm assuming?
but i don't do much else with coding besides java and a bit of python	i actually have no idea how eclipse will run on something like a pi, so gotta test that out lol
plus i wouldnt k how to use lol	technically, the pi itself belongs to the group (since etf), only the sd card belongs to me
or like how did u make it it seems so legit lol	there's a lot of documentation on that if you want to take a look. i've just been using xml files (i think that's what it was) to get it working. i do
ok :)	btw, not to bring up a touchy subject rn in our manly brotherhood of bonding
when none of that matters if we haven't done shit in the project	hmm
thats the problem with business ppl, we have large egos that need to be stroked constatnly	hmm, during this meeting while i was listening i did notice some tendencies
and it sucks	hmm, i believe it can be fixed though!
thanks roy	btw, has the group dynamic always been like this for the past years?
nah its been more and more like this as we have less and less to do	i see...
and jen and maddie can't	oh, welp didn't know about that then
but at least im self aware	idk, you're the one in ap cs!
keep doing amazing stuff	oh one more thing
ve historically been the one organizing and doing the overall management, but thats more like my specialty in the team rather than my part as a leader	ahh
we try to make sure all decisions run by everyone	i'm an arrogant idiot and forgot how long it takes to actually install an os...
hey come to the caf were having a documentation meating	ok
yo soy good 你呢?	just hw and anticipation for the busy week that is next week
wat class u in now?	just a study
roy u should do escape the room with me vara and maddie tomorrow!	?
u have to do a series of puzzles to "escape"	wut doeth though think of dis thesis?
dang mine was like much worse	nah dun worry, vara's helping me tear this thesis a new asshole
lol	wait a sec, past tense or present?
yoo roy why u still up	donahue essayyy
if ur not busy	nah, hit me now pls
or smthing like that he mentioned	yeh
ill talk to him tomorrow at robotics	so i need to get a sex change, got it!!
lol	but in a seriousness, thanks for the opportunity man! i don't really know how to repay you! (you want some free wires?)
i mean u r the robotics master in our grade lol	lol thx, idk i still got a lot to prove if i want to stand up there with the big boys
about web dev	oh dang, getting to know dat html?
lol yup	oh btw, since you're studying web dev atm, for av i can only stream the video feed to a browser which access the feed though the ip of the pi and the 
i think youll have to ask vara	ahh ic ic
they''ll come otu with resuls by wednesday	dang, dat suspenseful wait
ikr	btw, do i still have to get rid of my manhood?
oh shit i forgot to talk to petty	it ok
ill talk to him tomorrow or emial him	thank u, thank u
lol	will zhou get mad if we use wikipedia?
nahhhh	nicee
cuz it can be by election or application, but both have downfalls	hmm
i guess there's always the problem with nepotism	in terms of just organization though, i feel as if everyone contributing to the study guide would be nice, instead of just relying on the officers. so
tru	hmm, in the case of nepotism, don't elections also are filled with it
i'm more talking about for later yrs when we all graduate	ooh
we dont have a dedicated enough teacher to do that	wait a sec, petty choose the captains? dang, i was under the impression that role fell upon the previous captain
but petty has the final say i think	ic ic
this is for president right? not eo	si, el presidente
i'm reaching out to ppl from other teams to see what they do too	ahh ic ic
for bboth robotics and sci oly	ik how u feel man
i'm banking on the rising freshmen to be really good	i feel like bio is fine with our presidente still around
he's the only one to have already taken ohysics	david said that he's interested in joining next year
good	for robotics...
just woke up lol	niiiceee
but im coming to sci oly nyways lol	don't die man!
oh sweet	get lots o' rest!
i'll try to make it, i'm going to sci oky	i miss you man 
u mean the radical revolutionary cheng lol	yup yup
basically i don't want to go in biased against anyone, want to be as open minded as possible	ahh
lol thanks man	how will the whole event unfold?
imma bring a notebook to take notes	i'll bring a boombox so we can play mary's little lamb
noceee	oh, idk if vara told you this yet
im gonna bring up all the ideas ive heard at the meeting	ahh ic ic
ur idea was pretty good too	thx man ;)))))
i like considered just leaving the project	wahh?
ya except it escalated like a lot	ahh
is anyone working on cubebot?	i ammm
i'll will be there soon	we're cleaning up now too
(im under my bed covers) hiding from my ruthless early bedtime parents	lol
my neck muscles oy	don't worry
roy, would it be too much for you to bring the robot arm to stem night tomorrow?	i can bring it
just for show	i'll hang the fifth place ribbon on it so ppl know wut's up
lol ok	anything else you needs?
i'm picking u up last so	time to chug a gallon of milk
*here	ohmy
much	who's luke?
no	skyrunner
where u at	holy shit man, i feel like all the bad luck just rained down on snatch!
i think kendall went too flame on that wallaby so now it's traumatized and disfunctional	lol
?	todos for gcer-who’s house are we going to store the board n’ stuff over the summer?-fix board tape n’ proportions-see if we can obtain more wallab
add make robots compatable in every combination	ahh tru tru
yo roy how ru doing the zhou lab?	i plugged everything in the delta t boiling point formula
wait what was ur equation	the formula for delta bp
can u send me a pic? im really confused lol	http://images.slideplayer.com/2/698948/slides/slide_6.jpg
dont u need both the mass of solvent and the mass of solute which u dont k	oooh
did u get around 26 and 65	25% for cacl2
wait what were ur degrees	102.9 degrees c for kcl
i got higher % for cacl2	same
ok thanks ya	no problemo
sorry i dont get this unit at all i missed al lthe notes	i do not believe you need to divide by total mass of the solution
isnt percent by mass based on total solution	then factor label with molar mass and then factor label again with kg
or should it be the same	the water in our measurements was just for bp i think
cuz our solutsions didnt have 1 kg of water in it	ooh
or is it 1 g of solution?	ooooooh
would it be .25/1.25 instead	hmm
but idk	yeah, especially with that version of molarity
they seem to be getting stuck on the cube	yeah, they also seem to be bringing cubes with them for some reason
maybe its just cuz theyre practicing idk	yeh, it certainly is strange
but we would also need more height, we just have to be careful about height requriments	the current snatch with the arm folded up (to fit in the starting box) is around 11 inches
ya, well see	can you pls send the vids of windmill to david?
ya though they may take a long time to send	he needs to see how the windmills contort or not contort when it jumps
btw apparently its name is watchdog	such a cool name
the robot. tho windmill is more accurate and less intense lol	david.mao458@gmail.com
i can send u pics of it now and  ill try to upload the videos to a drive folder	oooh
l where previous officers decide the upcoming officers is best cuz they're the ones that would know the club and who's most dedicated / qualified best	well, the botball method has proof of it working
what was chem hw?	just study i think
wait whens the quiz	tomorrow
shit	yeh, this unit is weird n' confusing
hey roy u still up?	yup
but also, when the chem packet says that homogenous mixtures are in one phase, what does that mean	gotta get dat chem done! plus i took un nappo ;d
ones a liquid and ones a solid	yeah, it seems like it contradicts itself
or is it that when salt dissolves in water, it becomes a liquid?	i just know that salt becomes free ions since it's an electrolyte
is this a quiz or test	un quizo
ok u should get some slee[	nah gotta finish the review!!
chem review?	yup yup
why u still up?	prototype
damm roy get some sleep	yeah, i'm waiting to get my hands on some hardware now so i can't even continue working if i wanted to
thanks lol	como estas?
yoo	https://media.giphy.com/media/aros3jkjfpfx2/giphy.gif
http://i.imgur.com/mdx8mec.gif	try this pls
nope	oooh my b
it says no site	aw man, i can't set up my wifi to be open... hmmm
yee	nice! not crazy
hows the gcer paper goin	hard
but i dont have ideas	hmm
hmmmmm	i'm just going to do the autonoums robo one
how does it work? u just submit it and they approve it and it gets published?	that's what they make it sound like, at least according to what i read
btw is ethan doing a paper? cuz he mentioned smtbn about it	really?
i qonder what level of untevhnicality they will take	http://new.gcer.net/participate/submit-a-conference-paper/
i won't so that tho	you can always collab with ppl too i believe
if i do one related to cube bot i might ask damian	we could always do one next year if that's the case
it doesnt factor into ur gcer score right?	i don't think so, considering we won last year and none of us submitted a ppr
i need to learn ros for beaver works actually so ya	oh, then just get started with the tutorials
lol be prepared for a bombardment of questions from meh	i'll prepare!
i'm not even quite sure exactly what it is	basically it's just
damn definitions on point	i'm really fast with copy & paste lol
lol ok thanks	oh yeh, the forums and wiki are kind of bare for specific answers to errors (probably given how big ros is or something) so i can't guarantee there's 
il blocks di domani è badeg	gracias mi amigo
pe	was the chem just to write a procedure?
think so	so the actual lab would be tomorrow i'm guessing?
? didn't u do the lab today	huh, i was under the impression that there was more to the lab than just that
oh probably ya	lol, it would be funny if she had us do that just so that they got more naoh solutions
lol	what'cha doin?
math class lol hbu	ooh study
im writing mine now	ahh
ooooohhh roy can u take an absentee balloot	a what?
just tell me which ones to choose	shona pres
i'll cast u as secret ballot so no jen and vara won't k who u chose	argghhh
honestly, probably jenofer is better at fundraising	hmmm
rebecca?	yup yup
dont be a coin flipper like me	lol
ya u should come	arghhh, but the skinder essayyy
ill send u vids of their speeches	ooh ok that works!
ya it's tough	jenn does get shiz done though, as seen with botball...
yup	from a stand point of just experience and what i've seen personally
what about the other ppl	pres: shona
oh u need to choose a second pres	sec: you
yup	if ppl do find out i hope they won't take it personally d:
d	d?
hid it from view	lol smart
i was just hiding tht convo from view on my screen lol	now no one will ever see those embarrassing photos of me in a bunny suit i sent you ;)
coy	?
can i ask u question on chem	sure, but idk if i can answer it
the one that's a base but not a base	ah, josh had the same question
do u transerr both h+	https://www.edline.net/files/_pmarp_/262ec01b9b255d063745a49013852ec4/acidsbases_review_and_keyp37-39.pdf
but where does the 2nd one go	ikr
with an h+ donated every step 	so h4o is the final result?
but u would also have to change the teactants to 2h2o	hmm so a faulty question from her?
i'll go in early and ask her	btw how do you know when h2o will behave like an acid or base based on the bronsted lowry theory?
u just have to k if the other is am acid or base	ahh kk
how's studying goin	notes
i just want to take a look at the format	lol, it's probably better to look at other finished papers
something to do with cubebot	ahh ic ic
u should have come!	oh how i wish i could ;_;
*ur	yeah
u will almost positively get in	idk after today i'm starting to feel like shiz after that error
dang that looks complicated	nah, you could do it
lol this is so high level	nahh, ppl like kota weaver could do this in his sleep, i still have a lot to work to
im just counting on learning over the summer	you'll be finneee
have u taken apart a roomba before	yeh, but not down to it's motherboard or anything crazy
wait when	near the beginning
oh lol wait at robotics?	nah, at my house
i was thinking of taking it apart and i remembered u being curious also what is inside a roomba	ahh
ill probably take it apart in the summer, it just came up in my head	are ya going to make into anything?
if ur willing	sure! but i'm sure i don't have to explain much xd
or jsut in general	either i guess
tho i will warn u its mainly gonna be u teaching me how to do shit lol	nahhh
ill try to brush up on depth navigation	ah! there's a new version of ros that just came out too!
or buggy	it's prets ok
ur not getting enough	ok then! it's decided
while doing math	lol
night!	do we have anything after school tomorrow?
dontthinkso	ahh ok!
ya i think so too	did everyone just go home?
plus got sats tonorrow	ooh
thanks roy	i'm sorry to reveal to you, that was nifong
lol ya i thought so	i have awoken
good job	arrghhhh
i left at 1 tho	ahh
ya	is the scioly form
sunday night	really wanted to crack some jokes in that submission form lol
i don't expect much new ppl from our grade or juniors	really? i was expecting more from our grade
i feel like sam might, but only if he quits wrestling	do you wanna have a quick look through the botball paper?
ya sure did u shar with me?	oh crap
but mines utter shit	oh be sure to finish soon though!
ok thansk	ok, i'll send you mine as reference if you want it
damn its really good	lol idk, i wanted to get more indepth
lol thats completely fine for me	welp, yeh, just tell me if you need anything! i'll be around
ill tell u when i finish	gracias!
lol ok	yo!
u definitely got it if i got it lol	ok we looking good!
hm	she definitely deserves some form of credit
are there any like tiers for contributors	i got no idea
if it was a legit published proffesional research paper then def	ahh ic ic
there might be official terms that u have to use?	oooh
corresponding author is like if u worked with an actual teacher/professor	ooooh
so it went pretty well for a pilot conference	nice!
hey what was chem hw	finals
oh shit thats due monday?	friday
i guess look at past labs	oof, just gotta hope future roy actually stays awake time
he literally just trashed all the officer choices and said i was a dictator for only choosing ppl that "kissed my ass"	ahh
lol was he ranting to u?	yup yup
ugh i got really offended cuz i tried wicked hard to make sure everything in this app is as unbiased as possible	ahh, don't worry
thanks roy :)	no problemo
idk y	er, idk if stark can even be used there, i just thought it was a cool word...
ya thats what i think too	well, i don't have much input to say about the choices since my knowledge on most of those ppl is very limited
ya i hope it will work out, i think we have a pretty good set of ppl	btw do ppl running have to make a speech for tomorrow?
still havent written mine lol	i'll just be spending the rest of my day grinding away at studies
in this moment where i feel like shit, im glad to have u as a friend	haha, thanks man
still gotta write that	you can do it!
ok thanks!	i'm doing sarah's rn, dese things be intense
it's probably mainly going yo copied and pasted from last yr lol	smarrrttt
i'm not gonna use it again	but but
i might bring it in for senior election just cuz	lol dat would be funny
lol that can be my speech, just go up and hold up the poster than leave	that would be amazing
now im screwed	gotta get a fire speech
its just gonna end up being a populatrity contest	ooh
yup	i just know i'll be voting for mark, you, sarah, and idk for tres
fck	don't give up just yet!
y u stil up?	i forgot to take a shower :pp
ya dw bout me	kk
a little less stressful	ahh ok! that's good to hear
roy u going to robotics?	yeh
i indicated that i didn't want to do a presentation	damnit!
urs was too good	idk wut to do now
they can't force u to	nah it's ok andrea seems to want to do it
ok nice	i need to get half as charismatic as david joseph in 2 weeks...
u should ur paper is boss	actually wut am i doing
do u k if it's like powerpoint format or is it like a showcase	matthew li and ashvin nair of winchester robotics present "see what your robot sees", our paper from the conference proceedings of gcer 2012
i'll help u prep	thx man t^t
lol ya def	finished your questions!
ok nice	btw
lol why?	i just realized that i lost my solder somewhere in my room! d:
right	i can't smell the smell of the solder
lol well check all the power outlets first	oh wait nvm, it was under my bed :p
nice	when are ya going to david's tomorrow?
my parents want me to stay home and spend fam time lol	ooh
i slept another 15 hrs lol	lol
roy what did u get in competitive robotics class for final grade?	a
ok. get ready for an a+	?
so i assume that includes u :)	lol thx man and thx petty
mainly pombot just needs to test some more and windmill has a lot of work	i asked damian to convince david to add a sensor (probs a touch) did anything arise from that?
last time i checked he didn't have one	ahh
and then all the beaver works stuff	a web app??
and sql languages for databases	ahh
i'm also using google app engine which takes care of some of the back end that php or pearl would do	may i ask what this app is for?
igh demand skills such as web development or graphics design and get them to do quick prototypes that fit the budget of an early stage startup setting	holy shit! and you're doing that by yourself?!
nah i'm working with youth cities. on it	ahh
which one should i do jade or indigo?	didn't beaver works reccomend one?
i've installed the vm but they have options	ahhhhhh
one of them was indigo	indigo is older, but so much more supported
is there anything better about the newer ones	umm, new features that ppl probs haven't used yet lol
indigo it is	remember doe!
they don't want us to use linux	b-but
but they said try to use non linux	lol putting a vm on linux to use ros
ya that's a bit strange	ah btw are you comfortable with nano, vim, or emacs?
so much stufff	ahh, then since you're tight on time, probs should stick with nano when using rosed
thanks for the tip	no problemo!
top secret stuff	lol nah, i can't touch those files
did u have to sign any ndas?	i'm not sure, hr held my hand through the paper works
lol	i just read snippets, i'm not fond of paperwork
lol u signed ur life away to the government	welp
they're allowing u to leave for fora qeek?	yeh, making up the hours this week doe
nic	is web dev and or app dev worth it btw? i've been thinking about looking into it, but i haven't had any real reason to justify it
it's just a bit too much, u kinda end up doing ok in both but not excell on either which is what i'm afraid i'm doin	ahh, which one do you like better?
i have to get more into both before i decide	ahh ic ic
also lol i just saw that link	um i would personally prefer after gcer
he's still kinda in his ansty mood idk wy	cuz of the jenn thing?
he also spits acid	hmm
but the reason he's been having a bad time is cuz he's so rude to everyone these days lol	huh...
and i was just that awkward guy in the kiddle	ah...
ya theres a lot of factors	ahh, shall we wait for him to cool down?
idk its kinda beyond just wait it out kind of thing	yeh
trust me ive tried	hmm, could we work on auxi stuff during the break time during gcer?
im so behind... ive barely learned ros	ah ok
funny story the vm i downloaded actually didn't work lol my computer exploded	do you understand how nodes work?
but i would appreciate this tomorrow	ahh ok!
thanks!	but a quick ver. as long as you understand nodes you should be fine
yay thanks!	funnily enough, at work i have to work with a ros frame work so i had to brush up everything again lol
lol nice	wait a sec
i only see ubuntu	which ver?
i only see ubuntu donwload	http://wiki.ros.org/action/fullsearch/win_ros?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=linkto%3a%22win_ros%22
distro?	ver. of ros
i'm so behind..... i've only learned ros by theory i haven't tried anything out physically yet	by theory?
cuz i haven't been ave to get it working	ahh ok
lol i don't have a good grasp of it. a run down of as much stuff as possible is probably good, i'll review what i k	kk
it might be in a later obe	ahh kk
how do you choose which disk to do load ros to?	ran out of mem?
like 10 gigs	ahh...
how much is a good amoiunt	i gave 116 gb
how to do u repartition?	er sorry, here ya go
how do u back up everything	oh there are programs for that
its not showing up in the disk manager panel on the windows side	ah yeh, ok
wait from windows side?	yeh
8	ahh
for some reason there's only one disk	dannggg 460+ gb
urghh hold on	actually i'm dumb, that should be normal
oh rll	ahh kk
but how do i expand/shrink	yeh, unless you got like an extra just for back ups or something
or don't show up as assigned to any thing	bruhhhhhh
only os is there	it doesn't even show up as "free space"
but when i right click none of the things r clickable	ahh kk, hold on a sec, i'll boot up to windows
confirm what?	like everything's ok n' stuff, cuz the whole entire absorbing process can be scary
the buttons don't work	brb, windows boot up rn
oh woops	back!
ye	oh huh, damn i think it was either damian or some other random linux user on an irc
how do u have linux absorb it lol	gparted
i think i saw smthn about that	but first you need to give it un-allocated space to use
lol i feel so dumb rn	nah it ok
?	dat's for the linux side
ye so i shrunk it	and since windows is the one managing all the hard drive space rn (since i'm assuming that the machine first was windows)
how long did it take for u to install ubuntu btw? like total	oh jesus i'm dumb
what do u mean by formated	it got ubuntu on it
nope	you can also use a cd, but i never done that before
but whats the diff b/w me doing gparted and doing the usb way	you can't resize the ubuntu part while it's in actual use
lol ya maybe we should do this tomorrow	is this alll for ros rn?
lol ya	ahh
but i am a newbie	nah it's ok!
i newb	anything to get more people on linux @_@
windows cmd cant do shit	lol
hmm where to back up	you got an external?
its my old comp	ahh ok
lol that would be mucho appreciated	kk
lol nah its fine	i like that word, "kadoop" i'm going to suggest that to urban dictionary now
thanks in advance!	oh wow
nice	now to make sure there aren't any files that i can't have the public eye see on that drive!
nah go to sleep	kk, g'night!
do u plan on coming to robotics today?	yeh
what did u think about that meeting....	hmm
i don't think the captains know how little work he actually did at robotics	yeh, idk now
it's sad cuz u do so much more robotics than ethan does but ethan knows how to play the game	yeh, i just wanna have a talk with damian for a bit or something
ethan not gonna do shit	i'm going to go talk to damian about thisi'm really kind of miffed
he hasn't checked fb yet thi	he's busy rn, says he'll call me back around 10
lol ya ashley over at hisbhouse	idk wut to do
the only one not miffed is ethan lol	ugh now i think i really get it
i was kinda hoping the caps would see thru that	so this is the "game" that my folks warned me about
it's utter shit that this is how the world works	idk to be real with you i was fucking ecstatic before all this went down
it's just dumb. i don't really know what to say	nah, don't worry about it too much
ugh wtf. i'm also gonna be chatting up damian to ask	just talked to hubert
i feel like i'm most bothered that ethan got above u like out of all ppl. it clearly shows that it's not measured by work put into the club	oof, yeh idk why the title business did that, even when we talked it seemed a bit hazy as to how that was decided
ya.....	ah, i just talked wit sayak to like just talk about the whole conjunction
i would be up for just 3 co captains and a tres lol	yeh, that's what you, david, and i were all expecting
nope	i feel like i should just confirm with him or something
confirm what?	but i'm afraid that he'll argue back against it
just so if we do talk to him and if it does go south, at least we have some support from captains	ahhh
p to kendall a lot lol of u haven't noticed. and out of the 3 of the caps, kendall has pros the most decision power / can convince the others the most	just talked to damian
y legit. tell him that maybe leader of robotics team should be those who work on actual robots over those who just do finance, as important finance is	tell kendall that?
idk say what's on ur mind lol	rn i feel as if hubert and damian will easily fill kendall in
so i wouldn't quite say that, that sounds a bit too salty	yeh
how'd it go?	still listening to kendall's reasoning
sure	can ya hear?
u talk to ethan?	rn
how's is it	he agrees with everything, things are completely fine
nice	um ok
roy r u in the room?	i wish
lol same	ahh i finally gathered and cleared my mind
wait really? in what way	idk he was just all disgruntled by the idea that "everyone is just motivated by college"
wait when wad this	during the later half of gcer
huh that's wierd. i guess i wasn't around ethan that much	remember when you, me, and chris were waiting for ethan to get back to our room to sleep, he was having a serious convo with the girls and hubert
lol what do u think i think about when i'm walking in circles around the hotel for hours at 3 am	lol
but there is sometimes tension bc of competition	yeah, after thinking for a long time (esp about how ethan feels about certain people in our grade being "in it for college")
for ppl	bruh, you're quick
all 3 of us want to get into mit and it got kinda messy before. it's rlly dumb tho	yeah, i'm now just worried more about ethan being paranoid like this
so jason can out logic him quickly and tanishk is a but stubborn lol	yeah, i see what you mean
i noticed david was also wicked stress about college stuff	yeah, i'm not sure how to describe it anymore
u mean the title thing?	nah, just more like overall everything
discussion about botball? or like life discussion	if not just to hang out a bit
also for sci oly	yeah, that sounds good
ok	besides that, how's beaverworks?
i got turtle sim running! lol	nice!
lol sure can i give it to u after beaver works tho?	sure
i think everyone's had a mental breakdown except u	really?
ppl like me and ethan get stressed out way too much about college stuff	idk man, i had 2 foot longs today from subway
niiiiiiice	how so?
smthn i need to improve on	i suppose that isn't that much of a bad thing
if i hadn't taken a step back i would be in like 4 more clubs and doing random internships left and right	art history club?
so ya. i have these stress attacks where i'm like idk if i will get into college	ah...
i think i'm fine now	ahh, welp i think it's time for me to ask kevin how to survive 2 feet of freshness going through my gut
wait what	2 feet of subway
lol	yeah david also agreed for a meeting
lol ya	we can all talk about our errors and ros problems now! :dddd
tho probably well just be asking u and if u don't know we go to the forums	nahh

maybe u can give me a master tutorial sometime :3	oooh nice!
there not very helpful	wahhhh
is it open source?	just look into your path, should be nested around there
oh ok	so, are you guys using python bindings?
what do u mean by python bindings?	opencv is written in c++ with an older c api lingering around
it's pretty fun. i'm working on getting blob detection working rn	ahhh
ya	you could also use simpleblobdetector and get more detailed in its parameters!
simple blob detector was wierd	https://www.learnopencv.com/blob-detection-using-opencv-python-c/
or it didn't work as well as contours	depends on your image processing doe
i just need to adjust numbers more and stuff	ahh
what's thatm	remember the quick blob detection that i put together a while ago?
watching u mean by threshold tho, what is the threshold acting on	the hsv channels
ya but what r u filtering out	any color that doesn't fall into my threshold
oh yah u mean just like creating a mask and stuff	yup yup
there will be color signs around the racetrack that the car has to be able to respond to	oooh
i getchu	is it a mono camera feed though?
also part of the challenge is to have algorithms optimized to work when moving fast	oh yeh, then don't even try bgs then lol
ya eventually when we're farther along	holy shit, my grammar is falling apart like donald trumps' wife's speech

so i guess he just needs time	is jenn gonna be ok too?
so i had to talk to her and convince her to come	ahh...
u should!	i know, deep down in my heart, that bill gates will smell linux in the air and chase me out of the vicinity
im sure bill gates uses linux too lol	i honestly don't know much about that man
thats one well documented jump	ikr
idk honestly lol probably just games	hmm, i wonder why the salt even arose
the 3 of us were in latin class when it happened, i was sitting right uin b/w.... it was awks	oh, so it was outside of the chat
e equally salty but now it's becoming more vara is being more and more offensive towards jen so that's why i've been wondering why varas been so salty	hmm
like u ;)	lol
lol that's u roy	yeh man, dat feel
my first kiss was the kiss ide	lol
ikr	how was the partay?
jk it was a bit lame but it was more for the socialness. we talked a lot and caught up with connections	nice nice, did bill gates perform his party trick of jumping over a chair?

rip im basically done with vara	ah, i'll tell you some stuff after i get back from work
yo	just got back!
also no one else i've ever met has been salty bc i didn't see a message they sent	idk, maybe it's an intense pet peeve thing?
idk.... when i try to have a convo with him he just responds with salt and sarcasm, usually he's the one that ends the conversation	oh yeh, i trust you to take the info and not like smack it around
in what way	i actually have no idea
he kinda throws insults around randomly	yeh, it's kinda aggressive
i feel bad for involving u in all this drama nonsense	lol
sorry, just getting some feels out. i don't want to drag u into this lol. trust me it's literally so dumb this whole drama situation	sounds like vara's just kinda stuck in a loop of bad feels
lol in pastafarianism it's just called teenagers	lol

and what do u mean by worky stuffs ll	i feel like in botball, perhaps its due to our young inexperience, but un roboto is mainly headed by an individual instead of a collaborative endeavou
and botball isn't complex enough to have the kind of modularity needed for real teamwork in coding	yeh, so i feel like a challengio group proyecto would be supah chill
lol	idk can't seem to hit the hey rn for sum reason
:)	lol

lol nope. just life feels	<3
lol	what kind of life feels?
or theres too many directions. so there is none	nah, there's just one direction
idk there's nothing special about me. it sounds ridiculous but i wish my life was like what life is in a movie	the entrepreneur thinks he's too ordinary
idk its stupid	nah
sorry. i've never told anyone that ^ so pls pretend i didn't say it. i'm a lot crazier and sadder inside than i want ppl to think	no worries, i got your back
spending all day at shool. spending all night studying. spending all weekend sleeping then repeat	what about all those projects and interactions with your close ones??
ya but thats nothing worth telling a story about	what about those entrepreneur fights/hardships with your close friends??
haha no... those things aren't as cool as it sounds. actually experiencing it is kinda lame	i mean in the jobs movie there was a whole scene of steve jobs yelling at a grown man about how he wants the letter a to look on a computer screen
s 1,000,000 average joes to make one extraordinary person. and i know i'm almost certainly going to end up as an average joe and i just can't stand it	i thought it just took 2 people to procreate
 mean i know everyone will reach some level of success in life. i just don't know what level i would be satisfied with. or will i ever be? i dont know	i don't think you'll ever be satisfied
but i get ur point. i need to restrain my ambition bc im afraid i'll never really be happy with what i've achieved in life	nah man! i'm telling you the way you interpret your life is the way you see your life!
idk i've always feared the day when i'm old and i look back to now and have regrets	ahh
entally wrong with my life now and when im a hobo at age 75 ill look back and regret not working harder or putting all my efforts into the wrong thing	what do you mean your efforts in the wrong thing?

well idk. like im sure she also wants to talk to u like before	nah, she's been too busy to talk, don't wanna bother her!

sometimes u have to be down in the dumps	yeh, i suppose you're right
?	i was carrying some robotics boxes and got so flustered when i saw her smile again i fucking dropped the box like an idiot >__<then after talking she
thats good	i wonder if she knows i'm still stupid and like the lack of conversation is just her trying to fix me, ahhh thinking
what do u mean	maybe she knows that i'm a mess rn and she's avoiding talking so that i can get my shit together
as life moves on so will u	whoa
lol	ah, if only time moved just a bit faster
ya i agree	not broken roy would've slapped me for desiring that lol

when would you have buttcheeks for eyes	when you wake up
cuz butts shit	i think we both need to get back to work now
cya	goooooood mooorninnggg
have you interviewed for a job before?	yeh
guinea pigs on their hands - until they released one of the male rodents had managed to escape his enclosure and infiltrate the female-only enclosure.	welp
damian = randy	lol
mit let him loose, there's no stopping him in the breeding grounds	"housing crisis"
lol exactly	where u @?
just arrived in north station	whoa! you're already having the interview?!
and i just finished	wait
time to head back	really
lmao no	oh
the amount of bs i will spew is unprecedented	nah, just speak the truth
welp shit	oh yeh
lolol	quick! msg jefferson
and say what he says	i can't for break to start
lol wat	strip sum wires of course
is it just me or is pretty much every black guy samuel l. jackson	you thought the same thing?!
there r ppl talking inside	you got this!
they were all very chill	nice!
so	we need to go celebrate, how about the pub 9 pm?
11 pm	ah dude, but i have a crack on my ass
your drinks will be 10x more expensive and there will be too many ppl to breathe comfortably	whoa, sounds like you've got sum exp w/ clubbin'
but at least you can feel like you've successfully bandwagoned onto party-culture	lol
but idk, i think it's most likely going to be summer	what useful parts can you steal from an aerospace lab?
to reward myself	you're still down town?!
ya ofc	dang, city walks
lol	lol
that was just creepy	nah
we need to get buff first	i read that as "butt"
lmao	wait, so you're city walkin' with two bubble teas, no gf, and texting a pantsless dude?
while everyone around me makes out with their gfs	maybe there's another girl in there who's texting her pantsless friend! then you guys can bond
their e literally all couples	3 way?
i just asked them but they didn't seem into it	lol
that probably means she likes it rough	oh god
nah we missed male rad remember	oh yeh tru
*mean	you can meet ppl dere!
lol	y do ppl yearn for companion ship so much?
because we're fucking weak	oh dayumn, dat was brutal
groups survive better than individuals	is it really based on dat doe? i can see that's where the idea comes from, but nowadays ppl dun even have kids
we still have to deal with hundreds of thousands of years of evolution	wut u mean doe?
but it won't change humans evolutionarily for thousands of years	yeh
fundamentally tho it is. society just repressed those feelings or directs them in another way	hmm
for romantic reasons	so then why do some ppl die for each other?
great book, i'm planning on reading over break	oh huh, so that's what that word menas
and in general, the population behaves in the expected ways	hmm, idk, i think a lot of ppl would die for others
most ppl wouldn't	could it not be just fear stopping ppl though rather than them not being altruistic?
altruism only occurs when u aren't afraid to do something that reduces ur survivability	why would people be afraid though?
about their own survival?	yeh
aka evolution	welp shiz
it's ash	i guess i haven't accepted yet, i'm still scared of others dying instead of me
lol she didn't read anything	*whew*
ya but like there's nothing u can do about it thought right	good thing it was deep talk and not like, dicks and gay gyms
lol tru	but you can do something right?
and everything else is out of ur control	isn't a large part of learning/research for better the life of others doe?
you can save in general a lot of ppl, just not necessarily the ppl closest to u	ppl seem to generally lean towards ppl close to them
wait u mean the longer the distance the more the empathy?	or are we selfish in the sense that we want the world directly around us to be "better"
would u rather help ur friend or help melissa from lithuaniam	tru
relationship distance	ooh, dat's a gud one
but no one wants to read about "smart-investor-man"	ppl wanna read about the bat dong
not necessarily egotistical	but he's already a genius
but as a comic book character he needs to "not think of that" so he can have unrealistic out of proportion adventures	and have killer abs
harder than a bullet/laser/explosion proof suit	lol
ya	the rest of it doesn't seem to fit spiderman's whole "responsibility thing" lol
it's pretty catchy	yrh
and "im feeling rough	"i'll move to paris, shoot some heroin, and fuck with the stars. you man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars"
oh lmaooo	i guess it fits the whole "high school teen" theme doe
and then continued to be a teenager for 30 yrs	lol
dude but tom holland is jacked	ikr
and u know they would be the most popular jock in real high schools	tru
so it's kinda unrealistic and hypocritical	dun worry
bc i have friends and am not a loner (mostly) and i'm not bullied	you'll be the young legacy movie character den right?
it's so not fair, thinking about it like that i just feel bad anytime i complain about anything lol	i don't think you need to reprimand yourself for complaining about your own desire
i just want to be able to say i did something or accomplished something remarkable in life	couldn't that be seen as an insatiable goal? not that that's a bad thing, cuz i don't think it is. but doesn't that "remarkability" in the end depend 
idk why. it's really annoying, but it also gives me a direction and motivates me	doesn't sound detrimental, in fact, it sounds pretty good
or else right now u would still be like swooning over her	oh god
if you guy are friends?	well she was like, "as long as you don't make it awkward haha" or something along those lines
yeah it would be quite awkward if u were gay af	when i ditched skinder to say hi, chickened out and tried to leave from the front, she caught me anyway, i couldn't just non-chanlantly walk back into
and go a separate way	but i was "pretending" to leave from the front when she caught me
if u act unlike how u normally would, she would catch on and it will only remind her of the whole situation and increase awkwardness	a feedback loop?!
do u think i'm good at relationships	i mean you actually did have a gf
bc they are actual relationship goals	i thought they broke up? granted, any gossip i hear is usually from ethan
noooooooooo	lol
i mean what do u mean exactly by being picked apart?	when we talked about life stuff it kind of startled me how she seemed to know more about how i work more than i do
like ehat	like when she said dat apparently i care about the ones around me and my relationships with them rather than myself
ya well rebecca pretty perceptive	yeh, it's crazy
but why does that pick u apart?	wait, isn't that what pick apart means?
i feel like it's cuz it's rebecca, regardless of what she's doing	idk, maybe it's cuz i had a crush on her
how much of a crush on her do u still have?	0%
lol ok so from that i would say at leads 60%	nuuu
what do u do	lol
oh	is dat bad?
is it because ur afraid a hug will get too awkward?	probs i suppose
really? even if it's like jennifer	i talk smack, but i'm really just a pansy
that's weird	really?
well compared to me that's weird lol. idk how actually weird it is	ooh, smack their ass?
i only smack ur ass roy	lol
uh	maybe i'm just an innocent fuck who just talks the talk
what do u mean	i mean i do attempt to crack a lot of crude jokes
wait is apush just 10 pages?	dayumn, you sure know your stuff
oh sweet	essay time
i'm pretty sure of ur awkward around girls, it's a complement for them	i should be awkward around everyone
it just means ur hopelessly awkward	or...
uhhhh	jk, more like incompetent in society
from "castle" season 8 episode 8 copyright abc	"blinky boxes"

about the fact i'm not black	oh geeze
and then comments r like: "you probably can't get this college, ur sats scores are on the low side"	what's the point of "chance me's" then?
and one better-than-first in every competition ever	just cuz they are attendees doesn't mean they know what admissions are looking for mannn
that's y it's cancer	dat's sum serious cancer
what's ur existential crisis about	i'm a virgin

so what's upm	idk
hmm zoning out about wat?	nothing really

i want to be a mix between elon musk and zuckerberg	musky bergs

like there's literally 1,000,000 justin yus	really?
woops gtg gotta do family stuff	enjoy!

erica albright doesn't exist	nah man, i mean irl
suckerfuck made facebook bc he thought it would be cool, not to get girls	oh
and that's why he was cut out	are you telling me auxivision wasn't to get hot blind girls?
u saw right through me	movie eduardo is way hotter than irl eduardo #facesmash
i have a blind fetish	lol
it would be so cool to be played by justin timberlake lol	"justin played by justin"
but maybe as ruthless	and i was prets sad when wozniak got dumped
ya	all the fat man wanted to do was make computers ;_;
lol	tru tru
like hidden in some documents	dayumn
but it also shows how little he was involved in the company	so irl eduardo was a dick?
ere leacked, sean parker told zuckerfuck that there are a bunch of "dirty tricks" that he's learned that will secretly push eduardo out of the company	they transferred all of eduardo's dick to sean's dick
it's all very backhand	was eduardo really that bad that they needed to secretly push him out?
u should tell him that then	i did
*"no"	"mark, i'm breaking up with you"
lol	fuckkk
but that means u would sue us if we kicked u out	oh shit

damn. well we hopefully won't need any of that	the controller i shocked to death last friday
oh lol	i was thinking of doing some sensor fusion or something for electric vehicle
what's sensor fusion	using multiple sensors to get a reading
why do we even need sensors on electric vehicle	using an accelerometer + gyroscope to get pitch yaw and roll
isn't it just driving a set distance forward?	nah, it can be a bit different according to this year's rules
🍌	hmm
straight up. it's better to be honest than nice and not hurt his feelings in this case	i don't know how to say no
that escalated	http://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/04/01-cat-wants-to-tell-you-laptop.jpg

lol	btw
ya i can try to help, i just dont really know what im doing lol	kk, after i finish up the circuit i'll have a better sense of how the program should work out
but u have the motivation to get through the list	i think it's more of a "this is my only purpose rn"

about dicks	"oh god, why the fuck did i ask burwell out"
woops sorry	🐱

i'm srs	"wow jessica albert, you smell like bu"
lmao	fuck, messed up the reference

nah it's ok, you will find the one	nah, at least not anytime for the next 5 years
*da gurls	i heard that's false if you're going into cs or engineering
via affirmative action	quick
why are my over two times less likely to get in depending on whether or not i have a dick	because dicks are dangerous
aiya it just seems so convoluted to me	it's the same principle as the whole "black ppl get priority since they are under-represented"
isn't that just racist in of itself	yeh
if the numbers were the other way around the black lives matter ppl would be torching all the universities	don't fault the ppl doe
can't trust the system	(btw, can i have the first page notes for equilibrium? ^^" i seem to be missing the part on k)

that's why christi was unsatisfied with eduardo	he didn't have a flaming dick
no his dick was burned off	lol
u get 4	i never understood that, she says that she never wears scarfs, eduardo says this'll be your first (which i thought was nice), and then she freaks out 
he was referring to sex	maybe we're reading too far into this
bc they couldn't have they're first time	because it's not gay to have a 3-way
lol but who's the 3rd	obviously sean parker
truuu	what i learned from that movie:1. stanford has the best parties2. sean parker is an asshole3. start-up world is intense4. harvard finals clubs are

ha gayyyyyyyy	does being susceptible to existential crises count as depression or just extra gayness?
sorry wrong chat inside joke woops	i mean, it does work ;) i'm confused -> confused about gender -> fag
and i'm straight as a stripper pole	justin, why are we here? why do we have such innate desires
but given those natural laws, we genetically always desire to be dominant or successful in some way in order to be dominant	but den what about those ppl who do stuff just because they want to?
but they likely would not survive very well, if we still lived in our natural human society	aw man
ya :'(	ol' fat n' jolly woz t^t
the world is not kind to the uncompetitive	justin, save me ploz
are u having an existential crisis	yes
grades don't necessarily correspond to aptitude but its the best metric this society has that is still scalable	oh dude
almost everything we can think of has already been done in some capacity	special snowflake syndrome
its hard to come up with unique solutions, especially in a country where there are already too many entrepreneurs	i feel like everything is unique to some degree doe
a customer won't look at two identical products and be like "i'll buy product a bc it had a more meaningful conception and design process"	curse you capitalism
is it school stuff	life stuff
whats the longing for? do u know	nope
so is the longing for burwell	fuck that shit
ok so it is like a girl in general	idk feelings
hmm ya i feel u	maybe one day we'll figure it out
😭	lol
nah suning doesn't count at all	"personallyi think firstly love is totally something that is a 2 way streetor rather it blossoms under that kind of an environemtnand love is more 
advice directly from the love master	so step number 1
if u stalk them 24/7 that works too	oh yeh

lol	wait why?
bc i havent coded in java in so long	pshh

well i'm pretty sure gay dudes go for dudes asses....	wait a second
lmao he'll no	uh oh
wait	you score more than rampbot
no ik	and butterbot scores more than rampbot
also ramp bot is also a backup for de	rampbot would become a backup for seeding too then if we make butterbot a legobot
since it literally does not interact with the inner side of the board, no chance of disrupting	butterbot + sdd is better than bb + rampbot
hmmm	i mean, strategically this is perfect
i just feel like haybales can be easily accomplished with legos so we could potentially score more with a create bot doi gsomething else	but idk if wong is ok with this
actually a lego bot probably could	exactly
well ramp bot will just be the ultimate backup	lol
it's still a rockstar!	you sure ethan wouldn't be mad about this?
isn't it 4 total brackets	oops my bad, to share between each other
 the better strategy it's better for the team than its more important than hurting one of our feelings, but i don't think it is optimal in all aspects	idk, thinking about butterbot's design i don't think it would be that parts expensive
oh wait shit that's gonna be like we going behind ethans back again	exactly lol
ok	i already put it down as a todo

i thought the plan was always after the meeting tomorrow	david and i were being goons and wanted data
but what would the data be for....	to rub our dicks on
we already limited the amount of ppl per team	and get a sense of what ppl are learning towards
which i dont think is a good idea bc it would reduce efficiency in those robots	more like curious to see what robots ppl will skew towards more
oh ok	fuck, i'm running out of the social network eferences

sci fi time travel movie	oh wait
looks inteeesting	yeh, it might fuck you up in thinking about life doe
the beginning is really slow, but at the end u see why its necessary	is this the one where he's like himself, but the real him is dead?
but the twists are pretty good. they were kidna predictable at first, but the ending wasnt	quite the crazy sex life you got there
do u think ur gonna watch it?	probably not any time soon
basically its a girl who is left at an orphanage as an infant	oh dude
omes a man, then meets a time traveling bartender who brings her around time loops so they can ultimately prevent a huge bombing from occuring in 1975	what
so basically he had sex with himself back when he was a girl and made a baby who is actually herself as a baby	wait wait
and then he later becomes a bartender who travels back and shows his past self all these things	doesn't genetics prevent that?
if you have sex with urself ur a clone	and split up the same dna
😱😱😱😱😱	wait
yes	is this movie magic
irl	justin
yup	oh yeh
but then he killed himself from the future (the bomber)	geezus christ
but eventually he would become the bomber anyways	y did u watch a movie like dis
didnt k	we're all the same person
but now ive seen too much	when you have a crush on someon
uh	i identify as everyone
it was quite insane tho	i can just imagine your mind blowing up as you realize this shit
dude hes his own dad, mom and daughter and killer	i guess it's impossible to be your own sibling?
nothings impossible in a time travel movie	idk if i want you to finish typing that msg
lol	oh yeh dude
damn	ikr
do u give it a dick?	idk if we, as the human race, should give our creations such power
lol	jeezus christ doe
that system must be extremely complex	now i'm really curious if they use ros or lcm or bd just made their own frame?

that's one part of coding bats that sucks	how the fuck am i supposed to fix this
of ur code	public string removetag(string str) {    if(str.length() <= 2) return str;  if(str.charat(0) != '<') return str;  if(str.charat(str.length() - 1) 
and the coding bat problem	write a method that checks whether a string has matching html tags. if they match, return the string without the tags. otherwise, return the string as
*error grid	everything is green
ohhh lmaooooo	i call bs
str.lastindexof (">")+1 would be out of bounds right	i'm using that for substring doe
i'm thinking of python	i'm so miffed
lol	holy shit
what did he do lol	public string removetag(string str) {  int len = str.length();  int a = 0;  int b = 0;  string c = "";  string d = "compareagainst";  for(int i 
but doesn't it now have to for loop through twice	i think so
eh whatevs	wait, did you go the last 3 days?
no	don't tell me we left david all
what's gonna blow?	the captains thing

"kiss my ass frankie, but you'll have to wait in line"	hmm maybe
uh	but i've never seen it
rimjobs are a thing	and i've seen a shit-ton of shit
please dont be searching up rimjobs rn	good idea
so it shouldnt be in quotes. aiya not mla	don't worry
is obviously about him cumming violently into some dudes mouth	why did you had to add "violently"
bc its a gun	that just made the worst picture in my mind
somehow	it's cuz we're discussing freddie mercury
ttru	oh bby
?	you friended audio
lol	i see you
when youtube gets too real	lol
this bo	he's a pretty funny comedian
really? never hear of him	maybe it's just that they're both young and famous and rich and successful and not ugly
why?	nah, i've just i just seem to do it extremely (in my opinion/self-analysis)
i'm pretty sure i sent u a beautiful dic pic a while back	well shit, now we need to invite someone into this chat so it's not gay
bc they're all pedophiles	o
? baby?	yeeehh
who uses it towards u?	ernest
🐱	it freaks me out
i guess pedos wouldn't like other pedos	what's a reverse pedo?
/ men	i"m into older women/men?
it was a general u	oh
someone needs to fill the technician jobs...	oh shit
which means it was clearly mits child	he founded it at cmu with other cmu ppl in the lab ;)
ok so cmu can be like the surrogate mother	damn
🐱	even stacy is shivering in cali from that
just not as much as the big m	lol
so how's life with u?	oh wait
what'd u think of that apush test lol	stacy beat mit
and mit wanted to cheer her up	lol
so much shit she never talked about	ikr
why is it ranked so high?	law and liberal arts
dickburn	it needs to be a bit more classy sounding though
but it's true	technically most of the big name entrepreneurs are from harvard right?
harvard ppl do get employed	harvard can be
nope nope nope nope nope	lol
we could just call harvard burwell ville	plz
burwell palace	oh god why
🐱	but then again
hell is handsome dan	a pitball apparently
my list says 5.9	for weed or for palace?
burwell palace	ooh
ya	apparently
:d	all these fucking college kids
lessgooo	lol
i want to do something cool during senior yr after college apps are over	you really up for it?
well it doesn't have to be an autonomous skateboard, but we should work on something cool	tru
gtech?	georgia tech
oh right	and this data is making me cum
are they that good tho?	so badly
interesting	holy fuck
we should make an autonomous segway	wait
u still have to controll it	how the fuck do we get our hands on a segway doe?
segway are lame	lol
weedtown	i guess berkeley can be nerdy little asians
fuck u	lol
wait what even is carnegie mascot	scottie the scottie dog
but carnegies the captain of industry	kaist, mit, g-tech, upenn's grasp lab, idk about weedtown tbh besides ocean one (now that was fucking impressive), carnegie, uc berkeley
but what if u don't get into any schools?	free gap year
🐱	lol
what do ubmean	what happens if you don't get into your dream school? (even though you'll get in)
jk idk i would just cry for a long long long time	are you looking for anything specific in a place?
i honestly haven't been exposed to any where else really	i mean do you have a specific thing you want to be able to study?
and entrepreneurship	wait really robotics? :dddd
but not too hardware intensive	oooh
aka boston or silicon valley	ooh ic ic
lol idk anymire	really?
:'(	g'luck!!
why r u flustered?	fuck
wait tell me what happened?	emo roy happened
so who is the lucky lady	megan fox
wait actually tho what happened?	we were talking about classes
what's her name again?	haha, classes
abby jin?	holy fuck i said haha calsses

🐱	and then "what is the class like"
phew	i'm not that awkward

abby jin	pls nu

like hiw	idk
i need advice	lo siento
that we can use for sci oly	you genius
*lmao what	yeh mann
where is this coming from	the prom forum
the what	president bacon mentioned it
oh lol	hey justin
ya im sure it could be	i-i have a website
lmao	https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=will+you+go+to+prom+with+me%3f&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
is ur front end good? i'll only go if ur front end is good	lol
it better be made from angular	you have high standards
thats what i learned from this hackathon	cya later bby
how longs ur doctors apptmt	i got no idea
wait are u coming for sci oly?	to come or not to come is the inquiry, however, little does the public know that the true answer is friendship
damnbnnnnn	looks like carnegie #2 is doing some good work
i refuse to accept	lol
who's scott?	isn't that the name of the dude
lol ya	holy shit dude
watsdat	ya know
and she's not in nyc either	welp
also lol she's way out there. i have no chance	i guess you always have vara to watch ghibli films with
jk	lol
actually i kinda want to watch princess monoke	but justin
cuz it's not like a romantic one right	you'll spoil it for yourself
i'll just pretend i never saw it and ask her to introduce it to me	crazay sex scene
is that why it's the only pg13 ghibli film	lol
well if there was gonna be sex in any studio ghibli film it would just be hinted at right	this is a japanese studio we're talking about
i can't imagine hayao miyazaki directing hardcore hentai to the music of hisashi	lol
so maybe there will be a large shift in studio ghibli content....	maybe you can meet a new ucla in ny and watch ghibli films with her
the most likely opportunities would be sci oly or gcer where everyone's a nerd	or sloan
tru	nah man
nvm	ok, i'm going to pour ph 7 h2o all over my body now and pray i don't get sub 80 on this quiz
what i said	i'm going to warn the ny police department ahead of time
what quadraped is this	think of like a cat
can i see?	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xcl1rqf_bkq/veqkgbm7rbi/aaaaaaaaag4/dhyfqjcmt8i/s1600/img_1121%2b(2).jpg
it looks kidna like cheetah	i think i'm going to break my rule of 1 project at a time
i thought u spent all ur money tho...	not the chinese new year money
roy	yes justin?
so i can talk u out of it	lol
when u have atlas	instead of saving for a house, i'll be saving for atlas
u might want to find a video first and a bunch of positive reviews....	if i flip the ultrasonic sensor horizontall and replace the controller with a pi we could put a camera on it too!
walks-ish	wait, now that i think of it
*mit's cheetah	lol
wild cat pft	lol
also bd = mit ppl anyways :)	you mean
evaluates to true	but isn't
even shitty windows cmd knows	what's that i hear?
the school in the darpa robotics challenge, a contest to build robots that can perform maneuvers that will come in useful during emergency responses."	"it was designed and built by bd and we're supposed to design its software"
mit	university of florida programmed atlas better than mit did
oh shit	that's the sound of not good programming
bc all the fucked up parts of atlas were built by bd	"never blame the hardware for a software problem"
well s.korea beat all the us teams so	hey
- 2016 academic ranking of world universities#63	forbes - 2016 america's top colleges#102	washington monthly - 2016 national universities rankings	"arnegie mellon has slightly hotter summer weather: (71°f vs. 71°f)"
bitcchh	lol
not too good	that just means carnegie is harder and thus only tru gods can pass
bammmmmmmm	lol
idk how	is this against weedtown?
and significantly higher post-grad salary	oh shit maybe because it's a cheap school???
lmaooo	lol
no	thx for the advice
i cant view the vid	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjnr2gksu6s
is actually scary	i don't understand it
it doenst cross the uncanny valley	oh wait

true dat	damn
or hovercraft, jsut without the motors	don't we need the ppr?
the frame	oh tru
also we're gonna be using tissue paper regardless at the start	i'm not sure about dat since once we glue it
i remember i met the founder of meta spaceglasses and he navigates harvard with these	what the fuck is meta spaceglasses and why does that sound so cool
and it seems like the company went through a revamp	oh shit
probably more likely he quit or somthing	what was his name?
roy would u be able to wake up early tomorow?	depends
i aleeady left for south station.....	holy shit
lol that's why i called u last night	you did?

lol same	remember those pick up lines we came up with
i lost my virginity last night	wow
i played just the tip	what the absolute fuck is going on
my ghibli virginity!	but justin
i'll probably finish mononoke at nhsmun	but you need to watch it with a cute asian girl or else you'll end up as a weeb
u need that	where did you put the parts?
kitchen table	holy fuck the framework works and it didn't blow up
thats why its discrete	lol
cuz no one knows what the f it is	the qr code to sign in next meeting
wait is this for robotics	yeh
so everyone has one?	yup yup
what	coding check polynomials
fuck fuck fuck fuck	?
wtf	i thought there was a girl who got in?
but thats it	ahh
is 4.5%	is that the new acceptance rate?
bw ppl are so amazing and genius	the school doesn't determine the ppl doe remember!
that basically leaves 0 chance for me now	would you say they are more accomplished or smarter than damian?
but they're hell of a lot more accomplished than i am	soooo???
fuck	i bet musky got burwelled from some top places too
he was bullied and read a lot of sci fi	i can bully you!
lol	"you're shit, you can't even watch ghibli films with ucla's. nothing you do in this world matters, everyone is going to die, why did my wife leave, oh
well i am currently having one	hmm
haven't some any hw	we have a meeting in 21 minutes

i'll wake up by then	would you like to work together on the apush?
im getting really disctracted lol	oh
i just started polynomial	bruh
but if u couldnt get it i probably couldnt either	nahh

what a little fucktard	bruh
bc the jungle isn't the only thing i'll be cleaning out tonight ;)	geezus
 j++){				product[i+j] = product[i+j] + poly[i] * otherlist[j];			}		}		polynomial productpoly = new polynomial(product);		return productpoly;	}	update
u wanna cum over?	well, now that you said that

🐱	so is that good or bad?

nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu	bruh
royyy boy toy	sorry, i was taking my last nap
waiti realized theres no chem today	you're a lucky man
🐱	bby why
i feel like david's worrying a bit too much	i think if we work hard we can make it
not thays it's not good to worry	that's what i said for apush
also what was the apush hw?	not sure
lol is he doing butterbot?	i'm going to steal him to help me condense the code tanishk made
🐱	are you feeling alright?
why?	you've just seemed stressed recently
mit admissions hit me hard	weedtown admissions are coming out in a week
hi ekkcjkwjxbwsnbc	on a serious note though, is there a particular reason why you got so stressed? it's not like you will go the same route
i mean i more the fact that i feel like i always could have been doing something better and it bugs me that it's already junior yr	i mean, everyone can say that lol
but the college u go to has a huge impact on what u can do and have access to for ur future	does it really? or is that just we think
vs like northeastern	instead of the college, i think it's more the ppl/friends you make
it's all dependent on being at the right place at the right time and the odds of that is much higher at somewhere like mit	hmm, maybe it's because we think differently
the pt is the "materials" at a place like mit are much more prone to success than somewhere lower on the food chain	but you can make friends, who make stuff different from you, just like building a robot!
yes he ends up doing the same type of thing, but he's limited by the opportunities around him. it's a matter of scale	then wut about woz n' jobs or musky?
just they're stuck in the wrong environment	idk, there were 100s of ppl making their own pcs at the time, but woz made the one that "worked"
literally any metric besides like happiness or that kind of thing	well, then doesn't it depend upon what you measure as success for what you want todo?
u can't argue that u would be able to achieve the same things no matter where u go to college	well, to take a poke at that
lol	tbh, my goal was try to ease your stress about college, but i don't think i did a good job
i don't think anyone can ease my college stress	well, if i've seen any trend
true	so
regardless of how gay we are	one does not need to be gay to admire perfection
damn	btw
but some schools will reject if ur overqualified	i forget that that's a thing
jk u do that if either ur very confident of ur chances or ur ok with not getting into college for a yr	do you have a safety?
and i mean umass is like everyone's saftey	i've just been looking at safeties' as schools that don't have the best robotics lab, but ok ones
bc if i can't get into the uc system i would have no chance in like mit or stanford	i would love to get into g-tech or carnegie
lol nice	but then again
how do u know the deltah	lo siento, i already turned it in
but i want to do it myself so i get the learning experience	of flipping pages in an old chem textbook to find delta h?
the sci oly spirit	lol
it's never over	oh gawd
wait why r u exercising	gym creds
i wish i had thought of that	dude
lol	🐱
pussycat	wow ok then

u should probably remove that comment	yeh probs

litty	have u seen the vid of the dump?
there's only one video and that's the claw	fuuu
;)	let me try again...
but we have modern technology now	wut?
that made me come in my pants	i tested it 10 times
and it wouldn't have failed the 30th time if the robot was meant to run at regionals	i then switched it to a screw
lol woops	justin too early 4 da memes
it's never too early	but yeh, the dump can't be too fast or else the top block is thrusted out
so the top doesn't fall out	we could try, but idk if we can afford the servo extension length we would need
why would it need an extension	cuz if we attach the mini servo to the hopper to keep the top block from falling out then when the hopper is dumped the distance for that mini servo's
wasn't it already gonna be at the top	oh, i was thinking of putting it under the hopper and having it separate from the hopper
oh	but yeh, we can try it
litty	sarah plz
stop	don't doubt yourself justin, we can finish this ;)
actually tho after 4:30 on monday can i just go over ur house and work on it	i'm going to stop you and send you back to study for calc
nahhhhhhh	we're sending the materials to david's house anyway, not much we can do
and like a screwdriver. i'm sure david can still make something insane	lol
i kinda wanted to go over ur house on other days of the week to work on it	does david know we're going for 7 btw?
in he chat	i mean, we can just walk to his house it's not that far away from mine
we would have to run it by them to work on gatherbot instead	curse you democracy
which no offense is still a useless robot	i've been hanging around ziyi and bowen too much...
it's just... our resources at hand could be used so much efficiently	ic ic
but then we can make rampbot better too	you got dem skillz too
from the back	you have any ideas for what it can do after wards?
🐱	🐱
always go pessimistic	expect the worst, work for the best
oh shit did i meme too hard	lol
lol ya dw i'm a bit more diplomatic than that	i'm still worried about david's kendall complex doe
how come no one ever wants to be hubert. poor hubot	yeh
	lol
no can be kendall tho	just how no one gets into weedtown
and i think he realizes it anyways	but justin
u won't hold the door for them this time	lol
as christoph would tell u	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=momue26x3mo
"you planted the story about the chicken!"	"you had me accused of animal cruelty"
more like i'm coming for your delicious sweet decadent chicken	geezus
"fuck you!"	best quote
ya what happened	dat chat doe
just read	ye man
i assume david complained to him	lol
having david in this mood isn't helping anyone	tru
i think its just the fact that he can't work on furrowbot anymore	he still can doe?
why does everyone think something is happening behind their backs	lmaoo
fuck too late	and then things spiral into tomorrow
up to u	yeh sure
d ethan this and i'll tell u tooif david doesn't ducking apologizes to me by end of the year i'm not joining next yearnot that he would care anyway"	david just told me "don't deny your part"
damn	wut is this middle school level drama
part of doing something that isn"t his plan	"you willingly let justin sap every single person who could've worked on gatherbot elsewhere"
also to be fair, its not innacurate statement bc we need good ppl working on robots that will actually run	we should, collectively, wean off triggering words such as "actually run"
thats to david	well, i doubt he's going to respond courteously lmao
ya well that's on him	nah, not a bad idea, just be careful not to breathe too hard and stir the pot ya feel
lol wtf kind of old man saying is that	well fry my like a biscuit and call me john, you don't know these here sayin's?
cuz he did say he specifically wanted to address the rift b/w me and david	oh, in that case, i already ask kendall if i could jump in, he said sure
ok	nothing about ethan yet
if all three of us	plus i'm just nervous if the two of us walk in tomorrow and mention something wong might be like, how come i wasn't a part of this
is going on	drama~
jeezus christ. do u think its better if i talk to him or all 3 of us talk to him?	i personally think all 3
ok	since ethan also thinks david's got emotions on the mind rn
ya i just asked kendall	kk
kendall just said he changed his mind	kk, i'll relay info
he says he wants call with just me	no problemo
ill relay any info	i just wanna work on robots mannnn
sorry give me a sec	are you wired in?
ya give me like 15 min	now that's an intense gif
sorry my mom dragged me to do smthn	is it the dishes?
ok im here	wow
well basically	is dis gonna be a wall o' text
no i went to get some veggie chips	lol
i mean i kinda knew that	damnit, the worst possible result doe is confirmed, he's paranoid
kendall also said that there's really only a few options and all of them are bad	lol fuk
oh he said the compromise we came up with on friday is utter crap	yeh i can agree to that, we left out a lot of details
bc even tho we did it for the sake of david's feelings, kendall said david would feel worse if he's kinda just alienated	really? that's interesting, he always seemed to like to work alone
which i agree with	whoa, damn declare factions already?
so have jason work on create butters and i go work on furrowbot	but bby i cant live without u
but i dont think its optimal so i disagree with thtat	really? jason and i had a long talk about how to do butters several times now
like his feelings wo't be hurt	who, jason?
kendall	i hope kendall told david that
everything has been through kendall or through outbursts in the captains chat	personally, i doubt a 1 on 1 will change much of anything
h strategies working all the way until gcer, because than either way, one of the "factions" won't be able to share in the success as much as the other	i mean
so even if we go with "davids plan", literally nothing will change except we purposefully don't score as much with create butter bot	any other options we have on how to move forward?
that will preserve the butters strategy	i thought kendall mentioned 4 options?
factions or do the wierd switcherama	ooh a few, not four, i'm lit
what is the real differnece between the two plans?	correct me if i'm wrong, but the main point of contention rn is who is going to work on gatherbot? david specifically called out that botnapper eats u
well botnapper has 2 ppl	the real difference is we're spreading resources more
ya i agree	oh what the fuck
and i put that in the botball cht	welp shit, we've been stressin' over nothing
yup	i'm guessing he doesn't know it's only 2 ppl
so what is the real difference between the two plans?	lol
but at this point, we don't need those resources as much as i thought	i was under the impression that f + g wasn't getting scrapped
ya im just saying if its not, than theres literally no difference between what david wants and the compromise	well, looking at it now, there's a lot more issues we've haven't hit yet with butterbot lol
so there's really no reason for contention	david is just paranoid af
2 seeding strategies that score a differece of 50 pts	oh wait
oh why?	i remember this a while baccckk
isnt he working for an mit proffessor	yeh
im not doing that shiz	he even might miss gcer to go to upenn cuz his professor
whats he doing in upenn?	we talked about this at max's house lol
i dont remember	upenn has the grasp lab, pretty première in drones, but not much else (i don't like the grasp lab as much)
i don't think im that good tho........ i feel like everyones seeing something im not lol	doesn't matter though, that's just how they see you lol
its just shi	damn, all dese competitive kids
from far away my shit looks cool. but its not until u touch u realize its steamy hot	geezus man lol
:poop:	i'm telling ya man
don't let my ego get to me roy	lol
:'(	but yeh
yup	fuk this drama
that you and i will be working this, david will be working on that, and the freshman will be working on the other thing	yeh, that makes sense
just like how i dont k about it but u do	lmao, no one would want to compete with me
in this school	kota weaver does!
hes not at the school	oh
idk if its still true, but back in 9th grade the wickys got $100 evertime they got an a+ on a test	geezus
?	there's no way someone would know who would be competing with them
and be fucked over even harder	exactly
and it gets in the way	ouch...
wait for what?	the apush work i mised
oh ya hold on	i owe ya
;) pay me back tomorrow night	ghibli flims?
sorry	aw man
this week	i just cleaned my room
well would u be open for us to work there at some point this week?	yeh sure
like me or david	i'm ok with some
create butters team or furrow team	but if everyone is there lmao
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqv-sy_uvqgdzotqa9w9ohuqq0zpfxlssgty9t-3ipu/edit?usp=sharing	ooh ic ic
the second set of questions are at the bottom of the this link ^	ahh ic ic
if you are, than it makes sense to just have it at ur house	david really seemed to want to have supplies at his own house though
but if he's taking the supplies he needs to be open to have ppl at his house instead.	kk, i think it's also partly since furrowbot is already at his house (i think), if that is the case wouldn't it be eaiser to just split the supplies
ya i think so	dang, chats with kendall are always so relaxing
i can feel the disaapointment	lol
lol	i was telling him the story from my point of view
but we might have to	this'll be the best rom com yet
or it could be a drama/thriller where someone dies in the end	probably the black guy (me)
lol tru	i also like how we all agreed to the botguynapper bot
he literally said he would do the same thing if he was in the situation again bc it's the right thing to do	i mean, it did kind of work in terms of how we compromised
wait we should put these updates in the discord	oh
in the summer	ooh waiting for season 3
sure	wait
incase we want to try that out	so we need this
we could realistically do	kk
i think we are on track to be board ready by fri	it's cuz of you bby

oh	why does tanishk have a pic of sayak working out...
and he decided to be creepy lol	why aren't you working out?
i thought it was pretty funny	can i have some context plz?
i just saw an articld	took me a while to figure out you meant "article"
there's too many variables lol	well fuck you too
dafuq	boi
how is life? what have u been up to	failing at converting opencv matrices to ros msgs
what	don't sass me mark
i don't think thats a quote from social network	the apple ii was a great iphone
what do u mean touch	i'm going to steal their shit bruh
where?	and their herbie robot
oh cool	dude
well duhh	bruh
student loans	dude, is this why marky zucky left early?
mit ;)	that's what cornell said too
significant	yeh, that's only if you get in doe
i didn't even know that. thats a lot of teachers	i talked to the cheetah professor at the conference
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh	and then he hopped into a passing uber car and left like a badass
dissapointed	lol
oh i also found a song that u might like	money is so much
or u can go to school in europe	"will fix ur roomba 4 food"

or go to japan	bruh
u can fuck robots there and its socially acceptable	i'm technically chinese remember
dissapointment	lol
what is upenis. i only know musky trumpet	oh shit
i feel like the middle of ur list is all of the hardest schools to get into	i'm pretty sure umich is easier than cmu
ya but stacy, musky trumpet, berkley, and especially weed town and mit are super duper hard	that's why i got my boi rpi
nah i think u can get one of those two	"roy, you're fucked for stacy"
going on	wow, and you said i was into milfs
bc i think that's ur biggest strength	cmu and cornell has the same acceptance rate?
i would go to cornell over cmu	fuck you
at least for me cmu is too narrow	according to kota weaver and some of the big boi robo guys the tier list of robo schools goes kind of like this:s tier:cmu, mit, berkeley, weed tow
a lot of ppl apply for uc	don't worry, we can both back up and pray for ucla
ur list?	wut other list? my shit list?
is it listed in ur order of preference	the tier list is
i meant the first list	the tier list is according to conference ppl, kota weaver, and my own research/opinions
ill comment tomorrow	but bby
where else are you going?	i just came
where? i'm guessing cmu	holy shit
🐱	it's strange though
cuz it's cmu	but they build their own robots too
?	now i have 14%
pretty sure it's 14	7% acceptance rate for the school of computer science (you have to apply to their schools)
ye their drama school is great	dude, all dem ucla drama grills
cmu is a good school but imo it's too focused on cs	r u dumb
sorry	yeh man, don't assume my major like dat
what	yeh boi

btw that robotics company that i visited on wednesday	?
also they were talking about how boston dynamics can't really make any comercial products	lies
it's basically our idea of an electric skateboard that follows u around	dude
and it wouldn't be practical for the robot to be anthropomorphic if it's job is to carry luggage	fucking
...	hey hey
it's movements ate actually pretty cool cuz the wheel rotates around the entire circumference of the body	let me tell you what's up
can't talk	you're going to torture this old man

damn	dat feel when 30 engineers at bd are doing what a japanese dude did 5 years ago
lol	i think i have decided
i don't think that's a good idea	i'm actually kind of concerned how the ri focusses super heavily on cs over physical design
amirite	i wish they still had the leg lab :'(
in mit	damn
rip sam	don't worry, his passion shall burn bright
just go apply for their humanities school	so technically even the architecture kids can take classes and apply for the robotics major
and trandfer	exactly
lol apply for spanish major	"1 week in""i changed my mind, i want to learn ece""but you're a fucking spanish major"
 you called foxy roxy.	 foxy roxy called you.
lol nice	holy shit
i'm srsly worried	about college? why would mr. "berkeley is my safety" be worried about college?
this is what aadhya sent me	lol
nah she said it couldn't be true	"i can show you how true it really is"
why	cuz i care about your health
i wanted to ask him where he got it but he skateboarded away too quickly	wut if he was a future you
just like in jojo	that wasn't time though, it was different dimensions
no one likes jojo anyways	there is a stand in jojo that can reverse time, his name is ringo rainbow
who hangs out with the other sparkly guy with purple hair	that description fits like 50% of jojo characters
he was on the phone	ooh
interesting	i have a strange feeling that you and ayudass talk about more disturbing things than we do
whereas im perfectly normal	i didn't know you were into freaky girls
it's more like "aw dick"	daw, that's adorable
u thought her name was pronounced "ay-dee-ah"?	maybe...
jeez	don't tell her about this
be-dick-lla	lol
ab-dick-by j-dick-in	oh god
ell-dick-ly k-dick-un	whoa, you don't respect those other girls?!
psh no i don't even know them	i like how it's creepy only if we do it to a person we both know personally like burwell
lol she's a family friend	"lay-anne" ?
it's "lee-ann"	fb told me on the feed
ya chris and i are part of the same family friend group	dayumn
networking!	have you networked with musky yet?
he's like a better version of both bill gates and steve jobs	no woz qualities?
minus the woman part	lol, wtf, why did you add the woman part in the first place
i was going for opposite	ooh
 he thought was too cold onto the table, where they had papers and stuff. then he adjourned the meeting and told all his engineers to get back to work	can't tell if boss or dick move
i have so many books on my reading list	i've been reading so many documentation on my todo list :')
roy u fucking nerd	b')
of that disparity	ha, gay
is that a type of controller	nah
i also just finished the selfish gene by richard dawkins, which discusses the underlying biological causes of morality and altruism	so, what's the main reason why ppl are generous despite it not being of immediate help to themselves?
did u know that that very book first coined the term "meme"?	yes
there's an entire chapter dedicated to the spread of memes through the meme pool in relation to genes through a gene pool	we talked about this on the plane meme thing for numerous hours and numerous occasions
oh lol	"that feel when mr. 'berkeley is my safety' forgets about our interactions because i'm a lowly aspiring roboticist"
oh that's more of a reciprocal altruism thing	" an organism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing another organism's fitness, with the expectation that the other o
r conditions where the cost to u is much smaller to help someone, compared to the cost of not being helped by someone else if u were in that situation	wut about ppl saving ppl by pushing them out from a train or car
so there would be some individuals who do that basically due to various extraneous factors in the environment	wut would those extraneous factors be?
holy shiiiiiittt	every meme comes from jojo
that's the most complex plot point i've heard so far	i bet your fucking gene book can't explain jojo
i wonder if i can find the sheet music	i forget sometimes you're a music boi, like sam
i've learned maple leaf rag from apush	wow

lol i've been working with the launchpad for the past 3 weeks	how have you been enjoying it?

ok more like 40 yrs but still	ah shit
wut	that meet-up totally destroyed my foot
i thought u guys just walked	cuz i walked for two hours next to a cute girl going up hills and shit
roy	and this fore-mentioned cute girl is part of the xc and track team

if ur actually hurt from walking 2 hrs that's beyond memes, u should get it checked out	don't worry i'm using some scrap wood as a walking stick
i'm legit srs	yeh i know, but i'm probably just really sore and i'm just being a whiny bitch
woahhhhhhh	i looked at it without any protection
well no shit u dumbass	send me more bby
aiya	mhmmm
no u lose firebending powers during the eclipse	oh
u will be strapped down onto the sofa with ur eyelids propped open	i mean that would only happen if we didn't our each other's houses down with us being stupid with a project
that's how all the superheroes do it	but we might get super speed like the flash if we do it that way
too bad i didn't mutate any fire powers or teleportation. fucking genes	if we put our penis into a microwave it'll turn green and super big and invicible
gamma rays, not micro tsk tsk	lol if only my genes altered my eyes to shoot energy from another dimensions
not green tho	geezus christ
also whyyyyy	lol
lol thanks roy	you have a way with guys it seems like
no its literally fucking just vara and jeremey	you have a way with very specific types of guys
one white russian dude and a sri lankan	this is your chance to be like jobs
theres nothing for me to woz	lol
i'll steal vara's advanced level html	lol
hatetyrannymaliceloathing	dayumn, that's a good acronym
i learned it from satan	ooohh yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee boiiiiiii
but at least i got that advanced level html	we can now make shitty websites
but i remember vara telling me she was crazy	lol wut
this was way before they were dating, like back in the winter	wow way before, you know, like a *year*
ya.. like 6 months	is she in our grade?
i think their happy tho, things are fine so far	that's pretty adorable
also ya, vara deserves it, hes been looking for a really really really long time	just like how you've been lookin'?
i feel like i've given up on girls until college	lol
no correlation tho	it's ok man
except it has to be harvard	*mit doesn't have enough ucla's in it i'm just going to have to go to harvard i guess*
"i just want to fuck robots" ~roy xing 2017	lol
except that's an actual quote from u, while urs is not from me 😠	tru
in fact all investors will lose a lot of money	thx justin, you're so supportive lol
dw i got u	in the future if i ever make a full humanoid with proper pre-programmed instincts of like walking and stuff
well they are all competing for the same government contracts and funding	tru
well also they're only talking shit about the companies and their robots, not the ppl	since most of these roboticists seem to get defensive when the audience mentions bd
lol	*i respect you, but not your creations*
wooooooooo	"your products are better than you are brother""that's the point brother"
-italics-	nice try lol
"fuck" ~steve jobs	"it's not binary, you can be a decent person and a genius at the same time"
damn what a douchebag	hey
lmaooo the suggested reading at the bottom	lol
lly interested in making money, but unfortunately u can't do anything big unless u have money so. that's why i'm into entrepreneurship but not finance	ahh
also lol nina in the sci oly chat	lol
wtf	i'll fix it don't worry
nah i won't be that successful	oh i see you
he beat edison and then went crazy	tesla sounds like my kinda guy
woz didn't beat anyone and isn't crazy	but justin
unless ur bill gates	oohhh
woops i messed up the pacing for that joke	ouch lol
i only kind of know how they work	same
and also is super expensive so it won't be democratized for quite some time	i don't think the controlled environments would stop ppl from creating more of them though, computers used to be huge and space eating
i'm saying u have to find a way to really shrink it before u can make it a mass market product or have major impact in daily life	ooh, you meant the product/integration of it into daily life?
u little r&d fuckboy	you little business chewtoy
jk	jk
chewtoy?	well i mean fucboi was already one of the best insults
i spelled it incorrectly	damnit
i think u mean specifically humanoid robotics right	and legged robots
ya that's what i mean	it's true though... only super specific robots are marketable, like the one that sucks in shit from the ground
bc robots that suck shit are personalized	holy shit you're right
i don't think right now we would opt for legged combat robots. not yet	lol, if wwiii happens when we're in our prime
i wouldn't want robotics to just be centered around military but that's the only thing that gets funding from the government	freakin' lady
they'll drop so many boxes on those filthy commies	lol
the social impact of war would decrease significantly but the economic and political impact of war would only increase	we could replace politicians with robots, i doubt ppl would complain about job security if that happened
i still think the last remaining profession would be strippers	didn't that come from one of your shit meme sessions?
ntists as well, just cuz the government's of the world would not allow the development of ai that can program itself to the same proficiency as humans	yeh, but there's going to be that one asshole in his secret lab basement
it wouldn't be fun if it was killing u	or maybe it would be
there will be a lot of new applications of ai that we haven't thought of, but still ai is the future	wut about robotics :'(
there's plenty of revolutionary tech but none as disruptive as ai	dayumn
all those damn cali kids	lol
*also gay af	*super liberal
but everything in california is like on fire	not the scarves
that was a flaming movie reference	ikr
wow you mainstream whore	ouch
too poppy	i read that as too poopy
how long does vara spend on social media jesus, its always him messaging whenever i log on	don't you ever do that thing where you wait for your love to appear on social media?
that's such a waste of time	wait really

*sexually	serially harassed
hold on i'm biking, get back to u in 5 min	wow, working out

well no cuz they know ppl would just target their apps to be that type of person	but that's called lying!
no	you're all going to amount to nothing anyway
u can be 100% honest and tailor ur app in some way	nu way
yup. for exampl for example, i care most about sci oly and botball, those are the clubs i'm most passionate about	rip mun
then i major in cs or smthn once i'm there	i would argue that's still not being truthful on your app though, write about what you're really passionate
lol	should they change that i wonder
change wat	nvm
ur still being 100% honest	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
what's the difference between a truth and a lie that know one knows and will never know is false	the difference
fucking liberal	lol
true	would you become my connection?
if i like you, i'll even add u on linkedin	holy shit, you have an actual business card?
well	i don't think i've touched linkedin for years
actual is a strong word	lol
"justin, i'm ceo bitch	oh dude
aiya	nothing is actual in life
wrong movie u nitwit	my b my b
wrong movie u lesbo jacker	what is a bitch crank?
cum tortoise	where are these newfangle insults coming from

i'm yellow and have a dick	ooh, ic ic, you're setting your expectations low so you won't be dissapointed
i've listed out everything already, not even close to damian	lol, geez
the only thing giving me hope is chicken girl	do you think anyone at whs has a chance then?
so idk	so in the asian circle
cuz she's a girl	wow
ya	do you think the ri will let me be their janitor?
or that ur probably gonna stick ur dick into some of them	then how about becoming an undergrad there?
u would still probably stick ur dick into somewhere it shouldn't be	i mean, they won't know until they admit me right?
nah u got dis	you're going to get into weedtown
🐱	so when should i sell you a broken bipedal robot design in the future?

doesnt seem too wired in to me	justin software
"we believe in bipedal robots"	lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0tayhjpofo	lol
for my gtech app im considering putting down for "why gtech" because their meme page is so spicy	holy shit
tbh if i want to stand out i should jst submit like a dick pic or smthn	geezus
that would be my first essay to grab their attention, and the rest are serious	i mean you could also send a pic of hitler, that also works lol
tho i don't think they have quotas	yeh, but like
thats why i said i dont think they have quotas	*whew*
they could totally have quotas	since sayak ruined any of our chances of getting gf
welp they havent accepted a single kid the past two years	tru
so last one was sayak	maybe they've been comparing whs kids to sayak
fuck i cant match that level of girlfriend point average	lol
dammmmmnn did sayak get a 2380 on sats	idk
one got 2380, one got 2225	i know the other dude is maddie's older bro
total admits?	ye
too many to count for harvard	holy shit
more like im too lazy to count xd	it's kind of interesting, i've only seen you and vara use "xd"
76 to mit	lol
so basically if ur only slightly not good enough for harvard and mit but overqualified for most other schools ur royally fucked	i'm pretty sure we can't be overqualified for the types of colleges we're aiming for
royally fucked = more fucked in the ass than roy	geezus
like if u dont show sufficient interest	that's why you don't treat them as safeties lol
the common app came out, everyones applying to like 20 schools. so the applicant pool for every college has increased but their yield is also way down	cuz people be search, replace school names like chumps
or their parents write their apps lol	smh, no shame
ok mr "im not happy with stanford"	lol
not bad	what's cmu?
19/82	wait, school by school, damnit cmu
but not the cs or information systems school	"cmu school of architecture: 60% acceptance rate" goddamnit architecture
the two schools where my sat is too shitty for are gtech and caltech	lol
hopefully my retake is better tho	my gpa is too low for so many places
how many gfs	3.9
wow not enough gfs	holy shit, from now on we're going to refer to gpas as gfs
and thus a new meme is born	hallalugiah
u didnt take sats tho	exactly
btw how long does physics take	the online hw took me like 15 minutes?
shit we have to read a book	it's 157 pgs
wait so the chapter 9 hw stuff we dont have to do?	not until sept 11
i have no clue	i'm under the impression that they have no hw
hmmm im reading carlsons website and all this looks pretty *optional* to me	goddamnit dude lol
that should is telling me smthn	yes
"it *would be great* if you could"	carlson just has a passive/nice writing style
done	holy shit
"enjoy the summer as much as possible.  --mr. c"	let me go ask a white and or black person so i can relate our earwax problems
lol wut earwax wut	you lawyer-esque mofo lol
ew	actually, i wonder why i have wet earwax
did u buy the einstein book	carlson sent the link to it dude
"marxists.org"	and yet you know what cat dics look like
lol why marxists.org	the subtlety is amazing
was that from carlsons list	nope
im gonna self study it	so beautiful
i also already took an online course on psych for fun in freshman yr	ok mr. i fuck pluto's books for fun
lol who	ok nvm
bc humans are fucking wierdos	i think that makes it even cooler doe
holy shit aadhya just sent me a cat penis again	you guys have the weirdest relationship
lol she followed it with "what you eat dogs, get over it"	what
lol	maybe this is her way of confessing her love to you
lol	don't give her any scarfs
true	i'm warnin' ya now
why is damian such a god	cuz he does what he loves to do lol
another population that just does what they love: potheads	and i think it's pretty impressive when you smoke like a fucking dragon
but nahhhhhhh	should i ask him if i can take a peek if it's <3?
but the content is jsut so golden	wow
lol im not saying i can do better at all, im jsut saying based on what ive seen	jk that's too intimate for me
hey this is a pretty good song	ikr
i have a song	yeh?
but u have to promise to listen to the entire thing	...
its really good i promise ;)	if this spews dubstep into my ear last second
but you have to listen to all of it	lol, i was on my student account
u can just play it through messenger	does this count as dubstep?
just kidding i couldnt finish the whole song cuz it was so bad	lol
yes	i'm a minute away from the end now
like why this song, its suppose to be a sad song from kill bill	oooh
oh ya its only funny if you actively listen to the original	lol, it was literally the same song played like 3 times
also the albatroaz song i sent u, 800 million views, its sooo cringy	i'm just tired of bass drops in everything lol
and ya aadhya is wierd	it's like shakespeare barfed out shit and then someone called it art
ve once told his artist son: "your work is shit." .... the cans were meant as "an act of defiant mockery of the art world, artists, and art criticism"	when your meme becomes a modern art piece
who the fuck does tht. who could be srsly that rich and bored	maybe musky
not literal cans of shit	he spent his money on a new wife
they opened a can and inside was a smaller can, and they didn't open the smaller can so still no one knows if theres actual shit in the cans	this artist
like did you hear about fucking "invisible art"? its an actual category of modern art	some people just want to watch the world burn
its an "art" exhibit	is this what you get passionate about at 2:18am?
yes	lol
ist tom friedman has stared repeatedly over five years. the same artist produced untitled (a curse), an empty space which has been cursed by a witch."	this is yet another result of capitalism
its a fucking blank piece of paper	yeh, but it's a special blank piece of paper
wtf	easy
starting price is $500,000	lol, i'm pretty sure art is all about viewing and using your senses to invoke your imagination, that hasn't changed in all of human history, ppl these
🐱	so not only do you have to kill musky, you also have to kill his kin, 5 bosses to beat before the main boss
 what my work demands of the people interacting with it. you have to imagine a painting or sculpture is in front of you”, the artist supposedly said."	i want to meet this person
alright i relaly need to go to bed now	lol
fucking modern art	are you *still* bent out of shape about that?! lol
or one of those filthy romcoms u watch	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjfrmva7szg
kill it with fire	it's literally just confessions gone wron
the arctic monkeys are really good	what's the song?
like andrea would be a mardy bum	lol
its sounds like it could be a starting sequence soundtrack for an anime	it would be a cool ass anime
its like heavier rock than queen	i'm pretty chill with it
lol i thought u only listened to sappy rom com music and queen	well i mean
like the html death metal	i mean, i was in the mood for html man
that was some advanced level html shit	how to meet ladies
jk i don't k that many	lol
but ofc they're not gonna say anything bc a statue does not benefit the black community, but reverse racism can get their kids into college so...	i mean david joseph is also ripped as fuck
lol	we can then sue the fuck out of the system
ya it's just annoying that everything in this wolrd works on self interest. ppl pretend to have ideals but an objective ideal doesn't exist	are you getting all worked up about society during work? lol
 wouldn't be this worked up over the issue, and i can understand why other ppl aren't that concerned with the issue, bc its not of their self interest	i feel, i used to have rants with joseph
so its me too, its everyone	nah, white people are also not ok with it lol
i guess to clarify, i'm more annoyed that ppl don't recognize that, and pretend to still have ideals	have you talked with callahan or noel before? no one likes it lol
change is unlikely to come from those affected by it	i heard that's why some ppl voted for trump
it was the overwhelming consensus of the white majority who wanted to ban affirmative action that pushed it through	lmao, 60% against, wtf
oy vey what do u do in a world where everyone only operates on self interest	i thought you were all for, at least ok with everyone working on self interest lol
i feel like an english poet. i am quite disillusioned with the world right now	what kind of blunt did you smoke today bruh
oh wait ur not in the calc chat xd hold on	i wonder what the stat is for how many ppl support aa under each race in the us
oh lol	bowen's spreading that shit everywhere
everyone who benefits will approve and vice versa	rip dignity
*all	"i believe my race sucks ass mentally, give me ur $$$ and opportunities because i am disabled because of my race"
and i think just not considering race at all is more objectively fair than explicitly giving advantages to certain races	i like the excuse for why they don't use financial instead
jesus christ	i wonder if musky said "from africa" since he was from south africa
that's how hw got into stanford	i still love the kid who wrote "black lives matter" over and over again
lol	ok
🐱	also try not to get too worked up and angry lol, we don't know every single piece of data so benefit of the doubt still applies

jeezus	from now on i'm going to refer to uc berkeley as uc butts
idk	nice
oh really	have you not seen the giant ass coca cola building?
i don't know any other stereotypes about gerogia	you'll feel like you're breaking the law if you drink a pepsi

but i have records from the museum of science	ooh
the house of weed	lol
thats great	i should've let my hair a little bit longer
you look like u come from a college ad	sad and defeated?
why a month?	senior photos are due on oct 27
by a large margin	my bmi is actually over by like .5
ya nahhh ur fine	lol
to get buff	everyday i slightly become more and more like woz
true. there aren't any fat successful ceos lol	wut about
fine fat successful founders	waaah
*founder*	he was a cofounder
oh i mean yea, but no one thinks of him as one	in that case i feel like all of them have similar frames to you
lol scrawny asian?	jobs was a scrawny hippie
but chunky	yeh he was pretty chunk
is the ultimate part that it has a superior walk	nah
as in are you very focused on bipedal locomotion	the ultimate part
ic	i guess it's kind of similar to the goal of creating a general purpose ai
costs need to go down and mobility needs to go up by a lot	it's ok, someone has to do it amirite
lthough that also needs to work out), but more about  when the electronics and materials can be minitairzed or become cheap enough to make it feasible	that's ok
dw ill buy ur robots	<3
i can see that	do you still think that ai is the future for everything?
^ quote from my cmu essay ;)	"i will eat up your robotics institute in my enormous fat"
damn	wowow
lol according to cmu	although i do wonder
personalized ai	like in the movie her?
the next big jump in ai tech is when we can integrate ai into daily life as seemlessly as personal computers did in the 80s	the transition will probably be kind of tricky i think right?
especailly with increased development of iot	is internet of things really that worth?
its worth if you have a centralized place to control everything	which i don't
also a bit scary tho if it controls all ur appliances	or you can be a man
of smoothie makers	then what kind of appliances will benefit from iot?
so i won't need to worry about getting a gf :'(	wow
woops use this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b3ldwpauhykfmxj4s1rjshawatg	holy fuck
awwwwwwww	luckily
awwwwwwwwwww	i'm a lucky fellow you know
🐱	jeezus christo
;)	i haven't held hands with a girl before dood
ur mom?	nope
wow what a sad cildhood	wait
on my fb notification i see "your photo was liked by 'swang into ur dms' "	who the heck is that?
lol	lol
but still kinda	you horn dawg u
that wouldnt be	wow
unless thats how u usually talk with her	fuck i already sent that
nvm then	yeh, she uses "haha" instead of lol and stuff
wow u creepy ass pedophilic motherfucker	shit
"now"	dude believe it or not she uses messenger less than i do
oh thats probs why she hasnt responded to all the roy memes i sent her	what
ill save those for when ur dating	*when i'm burwelled
that too	ce'st la vie
ya im doing college shit	wowowow
aka the one that u were supposed to do in june	wtf is the sounselor form
nah i asked mr.burke, he said its fine	oh fuck she's responding to me
what happened	she said
phew	oh god i asked for what the library pass thing is
ya ur a creep	how do you do this kind of thing
ur fine just be urself	oh gawd
so might as well just let it out	> nerd> robot nerd> has no money since all money went to robots> is even more poor since robotics is a humanities :'(
be urself roy	i think
lol no we never did	yeh ok you sayak you
ive been completely out of the romance scene since middle school	you should like
not really looking to date at this pt	wait wait
tbh i don't think i've found the ideal girl yet suited for me	really?
watching a lot of romcoms recently?	lol
i think im a straight up sapiosexual	what does that mean
deal breaker: uses emacs	lol
aww thats ultimate romance right there	can i third wheel it super hard in a useless robotics r&d division?
aka the only application	emphasis on *useless*
i think intelligence and being a layered and introspective person is the sexiest quality a girl can have	so you *really* hate people who aren't as smart as others
well do u hate ugly ppl >:(	lol
ahh rebecca is the unique combo of being super smart and great personality and also really cute	are you crushing on her now?
🐱	hey dude
chris is looking for u	you forgot to get the apcs stuff
wait winchester library?	ye
where's dat	in the math area
where's dat	holy shit
isn't 3rd floor humanities	wanna take the same edx course for oc cs?
godsamit	buzz has a machine learning course we can take for oc cs
oh i saw that one	they're so goddamn secretive with their cs things
wait occs has machine learning?	yes
i didn't think the buzz one was super good	ooh ok ok
haver	he's in the office
but where would he put the forms if he's not in his pffice	"you will also learn how to use matlab, the standard robotics programming environment and learn step by step how to use this mathematical tool to writ
ppl think even matlab is better than ros	no, impossible
lol	holy fuck i saved myself
nah	so it'll be ok if i
but you'll be back by 5:30 rifht	yeh
by tonight	wait wut
do u want ashley to do post-processing and retouching on the photos?	wut
you want ashley make you look not fat and ugly? pick photo today so she make you look boom boom	lol
🐱	wait she can make me look not as chunky?
it's mainly fixing lighting and saturation and stuff	i was actually thinking about working out and losing some fat before oct 27
oh welp	:(
r u sure?	yup yup
i just eat what my mom puts in front of me lol	nice
i emailed him he hasn't responde	he probably won't be able to answer until much later lol
🐱	🐱
i'll change that soon dw ;)	lol
wow	2pure4meh
no	nice
we didn't do codexing last yr	do we really need to do?
someone needs to write a novel for botbakk	the tragic tale of how the school system slayed the mighty petty dragon :'(
lol the biography that only i will read	http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcstqyy8rptj8-gluebo1fz36ypz6kmkp86tir7iepwh5k0sqwni
oh shoot u don't k star ward	wut
compared to?	compared to the second half of last year
so i still have some sanity	you should huff more cocaine then
i regret that bc i now have a lot of work piled up	wait really?
mahacks, independent research project, e club, primes and mgh initiative studf	you're *still* doing primes? jeezus
tho primes only a little bit, i'm barely doing that now	:o you're doing a research project?
it's like pretty much dead	:'(
lol ya i told u, i'm doing one with petty	oooh yehh
lmao	"good topic"
mhm	are you going to make an ai that does something in particular?
i'm not sure yet	you should make an ai that can make ai
lmao that's going into like singularity shit	are you ok with the singularity?
t think if the singularity happened now it would have huge effect. only when like literally every object is connected to the internet it becomes scary	"my toaster wants to kill me"
wdym	*punching fire*
oh lmao	electric skateboard that shoots fire
we'll probably have a lot of time	that's tru
it will take over the world	lol, when our interests are so different
nah it'll be good to learn new thinfs by working on a project that lies in between our interests	like an ai robot gf?
roy i don't want to fuck robots with u	:o
wht r those things	one of the items that pacman can create
uh whyy	https://gyazo.com/9f131d743799c4daf86cc1a50f0ab5ba
but u can't relaly use it in regular combat	isn't it amazing?
cuz i could just hit it away	who knows ;)
fuck you	lol
maybe open ends training montage	lmaoo
the only feature of pacman is a godam triangle for a mouth	and that he's yellow
have u done #3 on the physics?	haven't started the new physics hw yet
isnt that that weeb game	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/cassie_head.jpg?w=738
whats osu then	oregon state university
are u actually?	yup yup
whos jonathon hurst again	cuz i'm a cuck
jk ik who he is from u drooling over him in our conversations	only one of the premiere roboticists in legged locomotion, cmu undergrad and grad, made atrias, mabel, and cassie!!
i see where the fetish comes into play	nah, the ideal robot would have at *least* two legs and two arms
perv	well what are you into
asses in the brain	lol
idk what this is	oh god
i found it on giphy	🐱
shit my mom is rigth behind me	🐱
kill it	🐱
🐱	🐱
🐱	🐱
🐱	🐱
🐱	i think we did it
cats	nice job bruh
rn	whoa
im not touring tho, im not gonna apply here	are you going to visit anything else there/travel to other unis this weekend
nop	ouch
damn	that was the lowest blow i've blown in quite a while
https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/discussion/comment/12067457	buzz eats #13 schools for breakfast
but they're #11 above colmbia	my dad studied there for a while
damnit my star wars referecnes are wasted here	lol
its a line from the 7th movie	luck skywalker
fuck uuuuuuuuuu	luke skywalker
but its actually rey talking to kylo ren, who's darth vaders grandson	wut
thats college confidential	is college confidential really that useful
especially the "chance me" threads	what the fuck is a "chance me"
ya.... its kinda dumb	i mean, is there really any point of that lol
its usually just "oh i really want to get in to ____, i have a 4.0 gpa and this and that ap" "ya no ur fucked"	lol
not sure	hory fuck
ur a whory fuck	then i can't go
jeezus	lol
lmao	all is at peace once again
🐱	are the dorms in uc hicago nice?
wel ashley gets to have her own dorm	:o
and its pretty spacious	she gets her own private shiz?!
ya bc she took a gap yr, so apparently gap yr students get first pick for the next years rooms	wow
so uh yay #feminism	wait wut
person across frm ashley tho cuz shes from china, and she asked ashley "how does a multigendered bathroom work?" and was pretty confused/uncomfortable	lol
🐱	why is it specifically multigendered doe
idk	isn't it basically just a family bathroom thing, why does it have to be called multigendered
it's genius	wowow
how to shit in a urinal	why
blame fb messenger	i've wasted this whole day reading stupid legged locomotion papers
s	don't worry
bc hollywood	who
lol ya	does that count as
all grown up :'(	wow, now you get another room to put shit into
ya there are so many at uchicago	a lot of ucla's?
no im not a creep	lol
^link^	wow
damn that's rough	i think you're rough
can't fist ur pacman today	🐱
lol same	is david ok?
eduardos the sucker	lol
i dont see why he would be ofended by it. idk how mr. mahoney would k to call him chairman mao	mahoney is a bro anyway lol
imagine if he started calling me o'sicc mcthicc	now that would be amazing
🐱	to be quite honest with you i've been on my toes around david lately/keeping my distance. idk why, but ever since last year i don't think he's the mos
ya idk david is like calm on the outside but super radical sometimes on the inside	it means "that's life; such is life."
like chairman mao	lol
chariman mao started off as a librarian	and memey
and ended up as radical revolutionary leader who accidentally starved 60 million ppl to death	"accidently"
abby?	lol
bc i kinda want to not have those kinds of friendships	lol
interested? i'm probably gonna be going	"4:15 – 5:15 pm robotics seminar5:00 – 6:00 pm roundtable: successful exits in robotics5:30 – 6:30 pm debate: risks & rewards of artificial intell
lmao	this isn't funny anymore :'(
wait r u at the school?	i'm at my house rn
oh you'll kinda learn it in calculus	do we learn it well enough to do shiz like this?
i found one on natural language processing on udemy	does udemy teach not grad level robotics
but u have to pay for their courses	what the fuck, they are pay?!
there was a sale and i got it for $10	will the school pay for us?
uh probably not	"your step-by-step guide to building an arduino obstacle avoiding robot using ir and ultrasonic sensors"
yup	i don't get why the courses related to robos so extreme on the spectrums
that's for ur level	i've been looking for so long :'(
just my love life	lol
how complex are these things ur making on the course	some of it might be legged locomotion...
he nerd	"basic" math
it's kinda fun to mess with their faping	wut
fixed action pattern ya perv	oh
and once they start it usually they are compelled to finish	what do spiders do exactly?
it jumps off and hangs onto a thread and kinda drops down	so it just spurts all over your pencil?
and then when it doesnt find it it climbs back down and waits again	you twanged its twat and teased it?
its intriguing that animals are just super complex machines	that's cruel
is fapping ur fap? ;)	i feel like you tried to initiate an intelligent conversation and i just didn't respond properly
it ok	once i start i *have* to finish
spiders fapping everywhere	goddamnit
 interesting if as computing power increases, there might be a time where we can run complex enough simulations that can "evolve" the hardware we want	ok
they would have to be super detailed simulations and that's why it would be computationally expensive	either you're on to something
roy hardware!	lol
no but legit. u know those simulation of bipedal and legged animals that are trained with a neural net and they eventually learn to walk	but in a different format
r, we could simulate actual hardware that could physically be put together, and use software to evolve the design until it accomplishes some objective	but the cost of transport will never be adaquet if we do it that way
that would be insanely cool	but yeh, i bet we could train the original atlas to walk perfectly, but due to its inherent design it's cost of transport would be shit
if u can account for all that accurately in software	you mean like the evolution training system?
its like how they used to object recognition before deep learning: u would account for as many features as u can in the object	hey, are you free tomorrow after xc?
awwwwwwww	i'm talking to jerry, what you awwwing for
oh damn	jerry wong
i thought u were gonna go fuck abby	jk jerry and i don't do anything together lol
fine u can go fixed action patttern with abby	geezus
and we are limited by our own perception which only operates on a pretty macro scale	hmmm
 object, but a deep learning neural net does it completely differently. it doesn't even pay attention to features necessarily visible to the human eye	i think instead of being so centered on being "bio-inspired" robotics should move on to more novel ideas that only its medium can create
then u can 3d print the robot cuz the ai would probably ignore if the design is actually constructable or not by humans	are you suggesting that "creativity" is nothing more than an offshoot of more complex thinking?
wdym	"i think evolving a design can create a lot of new possibilities that are just not able to be created by humans by themselves"
oh i don't mean bc we are limited in our creativity, we are limited in our perception	part of the idea of elegant design inherently comes from efficiency and stuff
so i guess theres two points -- (1) ai can reach a level of detail that we can't, and (2) super complex simulations can rapidly pump out new designs	what you're suggesting would have to the *perfect* simulation though
combined they could create something we wouldn't be able to imagine	there's a reason why there's so few actual legged robots
theres a shit ton of variables	it's because the creators spent too much time on simulations
oooh spicy quotes	he was talking about how in simulations you can tweak very slight variables or simply stuff are just missing and so the simulation will appear success
i think the turning point in history will come depending on whether or not we can create intuitive ai	or you know general purpose robotics
if u can make ai with *creativity* u can basically mine intelligence	https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=75&v=lcpfif63sli
even for intuition as far as i can see	if a person who cannot feel pain is tortured physically will that still count as torture?
no i dont think so	ok, you're crazy
i mean theres emotional torture ofc, but if they can't feel anything like it wouldn't be torture as percieved by them	i stick with the whole idea of "do unto others what you wish them to do on to you"
the victim would feel completely normal	individual cases do not apply to the group
im assuming this torture is merely causing pain and not going to kill them or anything	oh
but we're not going to torture ai	do you also think humanity will ever be ready for the idea/concept that everything they can do will be done/able to be done by ai
pain or negative emotions because of slavery, and all of its needs are satisfied by it, is it really slavery? or rather is that form of slavery wrong?	in that slavery case i think one should apply the "do unto others" idea
all thats happening in this "slavery" is that its working towards some objective that is given to it	i mean we could all just drill a hole in everyone's heads so they won't be able to percieve higher level thinking
that's what i mean by "intelligence mining". if u have intuitive ai, u can just create thousands of them for the sole purpose of *thinking*	and we could solve all the worlds problems
ya, that sounds like a happy world for those inhabiting it	:o
theres no need for either bc all ur needs and desires are met	i mean either having the greatest time of your life or dying
to a world where all our needs aren't met. but if we were living in this world and thats how the world works, why would we want "success" or "failure"	living with mundane purpose that you can't even percieve, now that sounds dreadful
ya but if that hypothetical wrld existed, i think its inhabitants would be much happier than us	based on our sense of life or their sense of life though?
i doubt even if these hypothetical ppl encountered our world, they would want "a more exciting life"	so if we lived in that life where we knew nothing besides a single objective?
if literally all of its needs are met if it pursues that one objective	because their life would be boring
ya but excitement is a need	let's say you are objectively the smartest, strongest, richest, and most admired man in the world
that would be met	everything be have been discovered or made
oh	it would be the same existance as the slave world, everything is done for you already
well ur need for new things would be met as well	exactlyyyy your only objective would be to "exist"
so u wouldn't feel bored	if everything was there for your taking i would feel as if that would be a very boring world
u would just "exist" with no desire or ambition for anything else bc all ur needs are met	exactly!
no i mean ur need for excitement would be met	nah, excitement is something that should never be able to be filled
lol why can't it be, if all the other needs could be met in this hypothetical world	i'm talking about our real world rn
that was a really deep convo	yeh pretty deep
jeezus fuck	ok, that brought the chat back to equilibrium
she sent me so many :'(	why
this is sexual harassment	yeh probably lol
🐱	nice deepthroat convo
🐱	🐱
for the oc bs thing	i wrote a full page
🐱	🐱
and thats his advice	lol
ya	just talk about how you're so good at cs and what they have there will make you even better
well im also applying to their ss school	🐱
social studies	ha
nazis	nerd
jk	oh, that's not nerdy
lol	if we both get into cmu can you please bring me food every month as i will be stuck in the ri forever
i mean bananas	lol
most certainly did not mean ‘it’ and called me a radical postmodernist ideologue trying to punish him for not using the clown’s ‘compelled pronoun.’ “	oh god
lol	i didn't even know it was possible to be this this
excuse me i refuse to talk to u if u keep refering to it by its compelled pronoun	i think you're gay
i cannot be coerced into respecting his place in this ever-expanding community of the marginalized by calling the film ‘it’.	how does he not know what one of stephen king's greatest horror stories is...
i already call ppl fuck buckets	geez
wut	and just how long you can hold a conversation for lol i just spaced out and read
i didn't ask for this	not everyone asks for love to happen
oh ya	well i'll have you know that scientists can flip over rocks during disaster situations
lmaoo	🐱
can legged robots flip over rocks tho	sometimes
...	surely though
lol were talking specifically about natural sciences	oh you mean those almost humanities ppl?
so i was saying companies don't have much reason to hire a theoretical chemist. chemical engineers, yes	jk jk i'm not that elitist
🐱	wait, what was his argument then?
he said chemists are paid like shit	yeh, my pops knows first hand apparently
*only chemists who are also professors are paid well	wait, i thought most professors were also paid like crap too lol
and grad students r free labor	wow
the only world where i become a trillionaire is if nuclear war breaks out and inflation skyrockets	and then finally we can sell a blindfold
in what fiekds	nuclear weapons
nice one	pshhh
what's that	holy shit
no i know they're a thing but i thought it was another word for dress	oh wait
lol i hope so	did you do the physics hw?
is that due tonight	you have 12 hours
how long does it take	i'm doing it rn
im pretty sure we haven;'t learned all of this	i think the equations are all there
we definitely did not go over this	"4685.1796"
rip	though i don't remember him saying the name of the formula
but whats the formula for the compton scattering problem	http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/imgqua/compton.gif
so inconsiderate	🐱
why what happened now	http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/09/24/live-blog-protest-uc-berkeley-delays-expected-avoid-area-say-police/
what were they protesting	i got no idea, something about the liberals not wanting the dangerous faggot to speak
is the compton shift the lamba' - lamba0	something something argument over free speech
*10^-13	3.911e-13
noice	want me to just screenshot my screen for you lol
to the og eergy	<3
bby	no problem bby
i tried finding my first calc test but i defintly lost it by now	lol

good	lol
where u at	i'm in the library
why avoiding sam	because i can't focus on my work when sam's around
ah. i feel	i find myself sneaking glances like a *creep*
*cough*vara*cough*	lol
didn't get anything done a block	lmaooo
:(	is it just me
wdym	like for example
hmm idk lol but ppl wear "fancy" stuff all the time	i wear all the fancy stuff all the time
;)	fuk
.......	dude we could go anywhere
why would u want to rock climb sitting down	hmmm
lol replying to spam is fun	that's so wholesome
i wonder if its literally his job to just reply to ppl's replies to spam	do startups do that?
damn	when you start a startup
ur just gonna reply with some random legged robotics shit and ppl will be confused	i can be the csp, chief shit poster
ya....	when the robotics conference is a talk about cyborg dragon flies
damn wait i don't wanna miss that	lol bruh
for the oroblem	yeh no problemo
<3	do ya actually wanna go to the conference now
when does open house start	7pm
ya probably no time	you can read the article in the mean time
mm u mean robotics built for an ai	without robotics ai would have no physical impact on the worlddddddddddddddddddddddddd
*boom*	boston dynamics doesn't use ai
is it ethical to eat meat	that's a natural process though
ha is it tho	i guess you could argue that both actions are putting an animal to use so it is acceptable
doesnt look very natural to me	when did you get all peta on me?
except arguably the dragonfly doesn't know its suffering	this is the perfect segway/continuation of our understanding suffering chat
*injuries illicit similar responses as with us	would you not say a child who pulls off a spider's legs to be one who is cruel though? taking away the locomotion of an animal
but the child probably doesnt have like hateful intentions	that's true
ya but the knowledge gained has since saved millions of lives	ooh this brings up the interesting railroad question, you know the one where would you save one person vs a group?
ya fat ppl deserve to die	i don't think i would push the fat man
jk	lol
whats the trade off	pushing the fat man to save say 3 peoples lives
and tell me wha tu get	art thou a facist?
did u choose to do the additional ones	yup yup
i forget my answers cuz i did this a while back so im redoing	kk
 don't care about gender, but i cared about if they were law abiding or not as a factor. and it was pretty much all the women who followd the law lmao	holy fuck you really wanted to save more people
iness" of surviving, i think objective factors like the # of ppl saved, and whether or not those ppl were at fault (law abiding) is the most important	it's a machine that is being used by a group of people that purchased it right? i don't really see the argument that the machine should prioritize oth
i didn't pay attention to gender or fitness	hmm, i agree to your points on that, but i still believe in my vehicle approach
from a moral pt of view, the ppl in the car are more at fault, even if just slightly, than random passerbyers, unless those passerbyers broke the law	how are the ppl in the car more at fault though?
bystanders literally have zero fault, and passengers have like 1% of the blame	bystanders are at fault for venturing into the outside
where it is dangerous	so the machine has the possibility to be dangerous and the user should be responsible to understand this fact
they can hide the exact algorithm behind a slew of intellectual property protection rights	ehhhhhhhhh
and probably won't actually happen like this	just the fact that the situation is rare doesn't exactly excuse the fact that your machine might kill you in order to save a random person you don't k
izes something over the passengers. it would only kill passengers if it's trying to swerve but it physically cannot swerve enough to avoid an obstacle	are you saying that this moral question doesn't even matter since the vehicle won't be sensing the people's age, gender, etc. and instead just trying 
so none of those social things really matter	would a machine be pc enough to call a transgender person by their preferred pronoun?
why does binary have to be 1 or 0? this is 2017	lmao
pc = python code	lmaooooo
wow fascist fuck	lol
not if they are the judgers of who should be killed	so don't trust ai to judge who should die?
for something as serious as execution	i mean a human soldier in the same heat of the moment won't be really able to make a clear judgement either right
wartime all the rules change	peacetime drone strikes i think still need human supervision at the least
ya thats right animal murderer	you're the one who ordered ham and bacon today!
but u finished it	lol
eww	what you got better pics of ai or something?
perceptrons	lol
can robots do this	is that really a visualization of perceptrons?
ngl the last ones kinda creepy but u gotta admit its cool	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk6l6bpdub8
fuck u	🐱
🐱	but the physical feel of the art doe
lmao thats what u notice	the man's got a good physique alright?
unless my mom can give me a ride cuz she works in cambridge	traveling by myself is scary
smh	is venture cafe near mit?
theres internet across all of kendall sq	is kendall sq around venture cafe or mit?
venture cafe and mit are both in kendall sq	wut
sloan is directly across the street from venture cafe...	holy fuk
what time would u be done?	idk
cuz ai is just so fucking awesome	boston dynamics exists
meetups are pretty casual. don't think of it like a robotics conference	so i shouldn't get all hyped and shake a lot of people's hands?
lol i mean u could	sending me mixed signals here mannnnnnn
im so thiccccc	lol
i feel violated in all directions	who was it this time?
ethan	maybe you should upgrade sam's security options
ya....	maybe make it so you have to feed him *twice*
double-nested-inline-forloop list comprehension	what the fuck
aww fuck yeaaa	i don't see a semi-colon at the end, no gold star
do u know what it does?	what does it do?
no its for my ai experimenting	ahhh
so it deconstructs an list of lists, puts all the elemetns in those lists into its own list, then filters out all the repeats	so would that be...
its just so beautiful	you know if i didn't press the enter key i bet i could write something like that in c++ all in one line
holy shitt they just updated smash	yup yup, yoshi looks really fluid now
oh nice they sped up my samehamehadaha	wait you mean your
ya	but but
she keeps sending me dick picks	lol
well proprocesing data is important bc that's how u optimize the ml algorithm	the ml algorithm doesn't preprocess its own data?
gtech memes	is there anything we can buy in cambridge that we can sell during open house?
to cambridge	i have like 4 hours in between don't i
when does it end?	8:30 pm
are u coming back for open house	i probably should
well more like would u be able to navigate alone bc i'm going back for open house	we should try to buy some wristbands or something from cambridge to sell at the fair now that i think about it
and we would take so long to break even, u can't really buy in bulk in cambridge	it's ok, i'll spend all my monies
at open house, idk about the future	i'm saying we won't have to break even if i spend the money and expect no returns
instead of losing some lol	ur not my dad, don't tell me what to do
ya... well in the end i don't think open house money makes a big difference for botball	publicity doe
we could just give away candy then	:'(
to attract the kids who attract the parents	wow, trying to attract little kids w/ candy huh?

i stopped by my mom's office and she had a bunch of leftover food from a company event	wowow
welp i would share some with u but ur too far away	some of these business kids are just walking by my room and staring at my screen with all the code on it

wait roy are you ready to intro ppl to build events?	what do you mean?
gh each one then have pictures of each for build events and the rules manual for binder events laid out around the room and everyone picks their top 5	oh damn the build event papers are a kind of hefty to read through though

ya	oh god she msged me
would u mind typing like 2 senteneces about each build event	what do i do
what did she say	oh oops nahh i didnt end up goingseen by abby jin at 10:42am

oh welp	you should ask aiyadiah
i'm gonna put it into a form	kk
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13yllqadm11ewi9ovuslh6bergyf4wwkc9y7l9zi-_ey/edit	idk how i feel about this language
when u use the python shell	that's fucked up
lol	std::cout<<"whatever"<
well it makes sense cuz ur using huge matricies in octave	oh, that's more acceptable for python now
but add something abotu what they have to specifically do in terms of tasks	oh i should make your phone so that every time you press "c" it automatically adds another c
in the "form description" not in the choice	bruh
lol it barely fits in the choice text	are you typing at the same time?
lol woops	ok i think i'm done

😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍	i can't even anymore

uh what's the cyber cafe	what do you mean cyber cafe?
wait so what changed buzz to become #1 with cmu	$$$
jk	if i'm going to be an artist
lol find a rich white wife	why white
bc racial stereotypes	i thought that asians were on average more wealthy than whites now?
what was the hardware problem? incorrect ports or smthn	the chip inside the servo was damage
its a sad song	what's it about? i have a hard time figuring out the lyrics
ive been listening to a lot of arctic monkeys lately	but it sounds nice
my music tastes are getting more and more grundgy	are you slightly depressed?
thats really good	why ya feeling so down lately?
🐱	"bet you look good on the dancefloor"
its a complement	ok ok
aren't they liks screamo	they're emo
or indie rock	i think they're technically indie rock
see not emo	emo falls under indie rock
fuck uuuuuu	i wikipedia'd this, so it's 100% accurate
so there	you should listen to some queen if you're feeling down ;)
fat bottom gurls	exactly
nah im at a festival celbrating chinese national day	today is chinese national day?
ya	i never knew that was a thing
68 years of the communist party	wow
u must be sacrificed to mao	you're the entrepreneur here
true	so are you like
and dinner	you filthy commies
btw r u and david having a fight or smthn	nah
and lol ok, i guess david just has a weird sense of humor	"i've taught ai courses in c++, java, python, r, and octave/matlab and i find that octave/matlab is the best"
ya ok well he's just jealous	yeh, before i would've just laughed and moved on
the course is like 9 yrs old or smthn	robots have been programmed in c++ now for years
ya but python can do anal	why is there an old grandma in that gif
lol idk	ya sick perve
tator	lol
i already knew u fucked dudes	whoa whoa whoa
but youve already fucked abby	holy shit
that's what the frozen  bananas were for right	holy shit
lol u eat frozen bananas	did you lay your head next to her? or did she just almost sit on your face
gayyyyuyyyyyyy	it's pretty good alright
lol jeez roy i kinda just collapsed so idk	collapsed on her butt
goddamit	next you're going to tell me she took off her shirt since you just collapsed
"next abbys gonna ask u to fuck her with a frozen banana now that u eat frozen bananas"	that had good comical context
that's why it's a matlab substitute	matlab has that index problem too
so i called him close minded, cuz like srsly that's such a one dimensional way of thinking	david calmed down to me at least
was he raging before?	really?roy?really what?david maodont play dumb with mefuck that shitto the victor belong the spoils, as it goesso im outfuck you guysroyno 
how are we suppose to know he disagrees if he doesn't disagree at the meeting	something something individual based pride
🐱	lol
all the shit bounces off those jacked arms	exactly
theres no fucking "victors"	we're highschoolers in some random town lol
we're all just trying to make botball better. that's what i thought of david as well but i guess he doesn't feel the same way	i think he's just nervous of you swaying ppl and shiz lol
if u don't have a better counterargument than you're just wrong	i don't think that's a fair way to hold a discussion, everyone's opinion and point must hold the same weight, that's like the only fair way, just like
he didn't explode at me	he's just too wholesome
ish	lol
if jen didn't say anything i would have assumed he was on board automatically	maybe we should have that group discussion thing about each other's faults and shit soon lol
ya............	we wouldn't even need one if ppl could take a punch to the gut like a man and not whine about it
lol i didn't k david hated me	lol
i guess he raged at max too?	idk if i would go as far to say he hates you...
.... and kinda satisfying....	if things get blown out of proportion we can say it lol
im jking hopeful doesnt come to that	yeh...
wait but its funny cuz hes the one that never speaks up if he disagrees	smhhhhhhhhhhhhh
thats so fuckin stupid	my patience and hope are waning :'(
its unrealistic to have all freshmen or first year ppl be doing competitions	i actually do share the same concern with him about the "elitism" thing
🐱	but again, that's a case-by-case relationship thing
in the past that's just been done with backup robots, so maybe we should rephrase the "mini competition groups" into becoming backups	that might be a bit patronizing though lol
lol well im glad im not friends with that kid	oh wait, that's right, no one, since he just bottles it up and just pisses on everyone 3 hours later
lol oh shit	i think my concern for not wanting to go to the same college as him
ngl kinda hope he gets into columbia ed	oh tru
so we can fuck around with it	i'm probably actually going to do that
:'(	cya laterz
o mystery perfect gf where are you :'(	lol

there should only be 2 right	there are 4 numbers to enter

cmu traitor	aren't we both applying engineering to buzz? i would rather let us fall into different pools
im applying cs	lol, don't out me pls on the fb meme page

it got to this pt	yeh, that was kind of strange
but it's been digging into me for a while	aw man

like i would normally volunteer to sit in the trunk but being memed into the trunk just didn't sit well with me	who else should i talk to? max is thumbs up no more meming
jk hes not but he acts like one sometimes	i'm sorry dude, i didn't realize it was digging in this deep on you
its fine	nah, it's not your fault
ya........	do you wanna rant about it? i got'chu
u sure?	let the floodgates flow and the piles of sand be washed away
when everything u do is memed nonstop it just feels shitty cuz like it feels like the respect is not there anymore	ahh yeh i see
ng my common app i've kinda realized i don't really have anything special about my personality, i kinda just write analytically or very logic-centered	oh damn
also just not friendly or warm towards others. i'm usually pretty reserved unless i'm reallyclose with ppl	don't worry haha
ya.... well i mean i'm fine talking to strangers	if you're worried about being boring, then i think it's more of a thing we're looking a bit down on yourself, or rather a lot lol

lol i dont think they take narrative videos tho	mit needs to step up their arts game then
but i cant do one on like cic	yes you cannnn
or creation	it could be the creation of your passion
....	i thought these were to show your passion and interest

so is it good or bad lmao	it's good
i like this essay way better than the old one	you take a spoonful
"describe an identity, background or experience that is meaningful blah blah blah liberal propaganda blah"	#leggedroboticshaveapplications
"i thought legged robotics had applications, and tried to take on the common sense opinion that they obiously dont. the outcome? they still don't :'("	goddamnit
you can pump out at least 1 a day if u believe in urself	"virtually all of stanford's undergraduates live on campus. write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help yo
lmao	oh man, there's so many shit posts that are possible, if there wasn't money on the line i would shit-post every college
dude i got 4 wrong on my oc multi test, all of them bc i put in the wrong variable :'(	:o
lmao it has to have legs tho	exactly
actually	?
to write	that would be metal as fuck
i just chose the entrepreneurial one	what if i put cheerleading
are planning on editing ur common app essay?	yup yup
but they spun it really well	"i have been rejected so many times in high school"
thats my identity or background that the application would be incomplete without	pshhh
my fate is sealed	you sold your soul to buzz?
🐱	it's a good deal my man
i don tthink there's any restriction	oh god, do i have to enter her name into *every* college?
cuz they get flooded by applicants	uc buttes
nah ri is that ugly girl in the corner who still rejects ppl out of spite	don't talk about her that way
the ri's building is probably just the basement ;)	the ri is a whole building alright
:'(	4% acceptance beeeeeeeeeeeeeeshhhhhhh (school of computer science)
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭	t_t
cuz she's a beooootochhh	she knows what she wants
its basically like dating a racist	psh, she's got the best drama program, with ppl who went on to perform hamilton, dat's not racist
ok cmu affirmative actions just as har	we don't know that
jk that was sexist	geezus
for cs	in the cs program lol
meaning they affirmative acion that shiz hard	i think the engineering is still crazy dudes
oh damn	ikr
who's actually pretty smart but wastes it all on useless things	and does that make uc hicago the girl who rants about socialism and no applications?
lol	wait
stanford is the alpha male who acts confident but is secretly sensitive and dying inside	wouldn't that make stanford not the alpha male? lol
mit obviously is the real alpha male	matla🅱️
i think theres only one way to settle this..............	what is that way lol
jk i have work :'(	lol
u think its just incorrect grammar, but actually its *"enallage"*	lmao
why?	nah, just wondering

plus i went last yr and there wasn't much new info	if you had a quadruped robot this wouldn't be a problem for you
would it be a skateboard then	skatelegs
idk lol it should be still going on	oh dude, how crazy would that be
let's start with exskeletons that give ppl 2 legs first	what if they get 3 legs
the perfect legged robot, is a human with some metal attached to his legs	goddamnit
or just peaceful song in general	perfect!
see my music isn't all emo	i was going to study all day today for calc
ha	not even college apps
damn those college app connections	connections? lol
ya isn't ur essay about the murder scene	oh yeh
what is it now?	i'm reworking the first one
"i've always had a desire to fuck robots"	my desire doesn't go too far past wanting them to exist and perform rn...
"when as a little kid i started humping every hunk of metal i could find, i knew i would grow up to be a roboticist"	it may be horrible to say, but the helpfulness rn is really more of a by-product, especially since i want them to _work_ first lol
the applications are a bonus feature	exactly
nah that's not boring it also might not be inspiring to others	"this painting doesn't _do_ anything, i just wanted it to exist"
wait have u asked hubert about what he wrote?	noperino
u should	do basic asians just make robots lol
lol nah the most basic asians do competitive math	am i basic?!
well lmk if u want me to read ur essay	shit though, it just feels so bad writing like, "i want to build robots that can directly help ppl"
just don't say "i don't care about the applications" lol	aw man, if i was applying directly to the ri i bet they would love this shit
why didn't u stay an artsy boi	cuz art is fucking static shit
lol well why is robotics cool tho	the dynamics, the movement, it takes on more meaning than just the creator's eye
so it's up to the software ;)	hey fuck you ai boi
for example scientific discoveries	but the sciences is understanding the world, literature is expressing the world through your views, but robotics is effecting the world
u have the background of both. u used to be an artsy boi but then u found an even better art, *robotics*	did you just get me to pour my ideas out? without my direct consent?!
ya that's right u humanities fuck	this is mind assault
yes	thanks bruh <3
it's not mindrape of it's consensual ;)	oof, rescrapping two weeks before the deadline
lol nah don't if u already have a better idea	i don't have a better idea lol
for a new essay	actually, idk if i can write a whole new essay with this idea, perhaps i can cut the boring shit outta my current one and put this inside instead
what is ur essay rn?	shit
oh so it's about legged robotics?	geezus
when's ur calc test	tomorrow
welp	ikr
uh now this got me thinking of prom	my advice?
thanks thats all i needed	that was perfect
for the past 10 min	technically i have to say yes
holy shit she's more out of my league than i thought	i'm just going to nod and say yes
doesn't she look cute in that photo tho	i suppose it's alright to stop and stare once and a while, but don't let it eat away at you
jk	lol
uhg	i think cassie is pretty cute
i need bigger biceps	lol
roy can u transfer me some via osmosis	i don't think i can do that lol
and this	i think she might be insane
idk how to react, usualy i just open and ignore	be careful
damn	yeh you can just walk in if an adult's around and stuff
what blocks do u have gym	if you just want biceps though you can just do curls with dumbells at home lol, don't need a whole gym for that
ok im not gonna. ya i'll just lift some heavy objects at home. like khloe	geezus
nah i think shes just crazy	yeh, be careful then lol
lol	gotta believe in love
by a girl	what?
if you tell her you like her she might see you in a way she never considered before	pshhhh
ya lol	but nahhhhh, it's her junior year and she's busy with stuffs, i shouldn't bother her
e thing in sophomore yr when i was gushing over jen, it seemed like such a big deal but to jen it was probably literally nothing except that one night	better if we stay strangers again
wait shes a junior? she looks like a freshman	whoa, you were a love sap in soph year????
lol ya	she's a juniorrrrrrrrrrrrr
:'(	ouch

cs	he did tell me there was a slight school hierarchy at cmu if you wanna switch and stuff (don't tell anyone that i told you this)
oh ya the students also told me this. like the cs school is kinda elite	it goes from:scsengineering and arts are tiedand then dietrich is at the bottom

ya....	do you think you'll make your startup by yourself?

i'm not cold but i don't think i'm open enough	are you going to walk up to girls and be like
im also terrible at small talk to ppl i don't k. i guess im pretty business minded or focused	oh that's ez, just slap their ass and become hardcore bros
thats called pedophilia. roy im not u	lol
i usually just think of conversation as a tool, like there should be a purpose for that conversation	wat
i wouldn't ask about ppls moms cuz i don't think thats important info for me to know	hhhh
like vara asks just for the sake of asking, he doesn't really remember any of the info later but he just naturally talks to be connected to ppl	https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2n3esu/conversationalists_of_reddit_how_do_you_get_good/
whereas i don't think to ask about random stuff unless theres a reason i should know or its relevant to what we're talking about now	to be fair though it also depends on the other person in the convo
i would be reported	lol
honestly anything in this chat is reportable	if we ever wanted to undermine each other
oh ya i think ive heard that too	decorum, delegates! your beloved dais would like to know if there are any points or motions on the floor <3 #munp.s. #winmun is coming.. shhhhh
lol uh first of all, if ur gonna be in the video get someone else to shoot the video xd	nah, i'm just going to do voice over

buble is pretty wholesome	...
wholesome	bruh
sorry thats the happiest song in my entire playlist	oh damn
lol are you feeling alright?	idk
is it still abby?	no
from that convo with ziyi and bowen	that's tru...
she also said she's not looking for a relationship, but that's cuz she doesn't know of anyone (pribably) that likes her	oh man
abby is probably the former	hmmmmmmmmmm
i'm only good at giving rejection advice :'(	maybe i should go try to talk to her to clear things up
so i would just go tell her u like her	you're fucking crazy
jk	lol
anyways the moral of the story is u should go storm to abbys house rn and profess ur love	i need to get a boombox
lmao u romcom fucker	🐱
it's probably a whole new ballpark in college	hmmm
what could happen	lol
moments like these where i sympathize with the zuckerfucker	lol

lol varas a bit salty that i decided to apply to harvard ea	don't worry about it
she probably hates asians	brian chang literally said
how tho	and you're not pigeonholed hole into your field/or study
mit barely follows a school by school structure and u only have to declare major after sophomore yr	not if you're going from the top down lmao
ya but at mit u can literally choose anything	jk jk, apparently you can also just blend together your own curriculum
same with mittttttttt	https://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/
u have to apply into it freshman yr	sounds like the ri
butbutbutbut at mit u can major in anything u want ;)	hey, you gotta believe
🐱	:'(
lol i dont think i would 'ruin" anyones chances	are you really going to use this site to prove a point?
its very slight	i bet the art kids at cmu are hotter than the kids at mit
true	holy shit, i almost sent that to abby by accident
buzz	buzz is love buzz is life

yes	wut if you decide to drop out of burwell's palace and found a multi-billionaire dollar company?
are u saying u would have money to invest in a multi billion dollar company	do you guys take a robot foot?
i don't have a foot fetish	hey hey
the prompt is "elaborate on one extracurricular activity"	if that's the case
but both mahacks and botball convey that i think	oh that's even better
"and then i told her, nice dress"	oh man, i just dropped fucking 20+ bucks to send my act and sat scores to cmu
wait shouldn't ur parents pay for that	i don't like having my folks pay for all this college shiz
lol	apparently i had some money left over from aptima
u should spend that money on cold ones	lol
i already submitted gtech and umich, o just have harvard	oh man
i mean ai isn't really a field for undgraduates either	yeh
foot-tall mech, “eagle prime,” and japan’s 13-foot-tall “kuratas” was meant to show the destructive capabilities of these massive machines in a hea...	ye...
windows movie maker	thx mate
but the interface has a steep learning curve	i have a week
if all u need are some jump cuts	do you have a setup for some nice panning shots?
have u arleady shot the vid?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qfl6q35a8i
what are u dong	filming me jerking off
ll	that's amateur shit
that are not as shitty but not as complex as lightroom	lightworks seems pretty nice rn

is that a reference	nah
i don't have a good mic anymore cuz ashley took it with her to uchicago	nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
wait roy i need ur quick opinion	go ahead
opposite for the 2nd	you meditate every night?
yea boi wait u didn't k?	look at you, mr. i'mamartialartist now
15 - 30 minutes a day	" talk about initiatives, being excited about solving problems" isn't something you would tell your roommate would it lol, seems a bit uh, "look at me
not like my own initiatives	oh god i just drank some cold water and now i feel like dying, oh gawd, is this my punishment for eating some ramen today?!
not b/w the ideas within each prompt	what
second one of what	the mission of harvard college is to educate our students to be citizens and citizen-leaders for society. what would you do to contribute to the live
 described elsewhere. min: 0 / max: 150- please briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences.min: 50 / max: 150	hmmm
merp merp merp merp merp merp merp merp merp merp	just throw me some ideas
jk	"every night we'll be sleeping within 10 ft of each other's asses, my head will be at least within sniffing distance of your ass"
🐱	geezus, don't meme too much during the brainstorm lol, or else it'll turn into a memestorm
true true	what do you like to do for fun man
lol	are you one of those ppl who will jump up from bed to record an idea they had in the middle of the night?
tahts what my red botball notebook is for	will you forget to sleep when you're deep into a project?
from coldd water?	i also ate some day old crab that i found laying around the kitchen
u dumbass	i might not be in school tomorrow at this rate...
this is why u need to be vegetarian, to cleanse ur soul	holy fuck
ru gonna be ok	🐱
hmmm i lose everything i lay hands on	would you sit down and watch a good movie or play some super smash bros with your roommate on a slow weekend?
but also those things are too basic i think or at least don't speak much about myself cuz most ppl would sit down and watch a good movie etc.	do you make your bed, or would you collapse on the ground of the bedroom
lol i would collapse anywhere	are you the kind of person to invite your roommate to come help with a project or something
wdym by th 2nd one?	would you be most likely in a club room, the library, in the dorm, at a party, working out, working a job, coding in the trees
probably in a quiet area, probably somewhere up high doign work	do you jam out to music while coding
it usually reflects my mood, either classical music or punk rock lol	or emo music
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh	ew... i just threw up a tylenol pill...
holy shit roy are u actually ok?	welp, i guess it's an excuse for me to ingest another one
🐱	lol
but meme aside, i think that might make me sound like i'm always starting things and never finishing ya know	hehe
that direction is gonna start sounding like my common app i feel	hmm, perhaps you should try a different angle then
shit its 2:04	the sci oly one is pretty good though
lol don't come to school if ur feeling bad	psh
1sr off are u ok	yes
gonna get that out of my view	wow
oh btw theres this really cool book/game i want u to read	making a voice over is so hard
eh ill wait until college apps are over	wut
but its really well written	this game sounds like it was made for very specific ppl
but we should do this after ea bc the story itself takes a few hours	oh god, i'll probably somehow make it end up as a rom com
one week of anticipation ;)	i'm making cringy voice over rn
how is it?	"hi i'm roy, and i will fuck your robots"
accurate	exactly
this application stresses me out so much	are you an idiot
i was just looking for ideas then i stumbled across this	lol, be careful dude
his essay is also straight fire	what the fuck is prepscholar
lol it's an online sat prep servoce	ha
that's a bit edgy	yeh sure
it's also kinda edgy	wow
lol	nah, jk i think it's pretty cool
ya	if you have a good point you want to express about yourself through that then sure go ahead
also maybe convey my openness to try unconventional things	how is that edgy lol
idk i feel like it's weird	just don't make it sound like you do this stuff to look cool or something lol
lol ok	if a girl can write about pissing in costco you can write about talking to homeless ppl
wut	wut
whos pissing in costco	don't worry about it
🐱	wait
lol im so bad at choosing	do you have a good roommate one you want to talk about though?
leadership, entrepreneurship / initiative, i'm a big-picture person, nerdy	ok
3) i like to learn a bunch of stuff for fun, wanting to k is smthn that drives me4) i'm open minded about trying new or unconventional things	well shit man sounds like the talking to homeless people one is the way to go not going to lie
and do it tomorrow	i'm almost done with the voice over!!!!!!
is it in a batman voice	lol
welp	oh hey
its probably oscar winning	pshh
"elon's musk"	is the first screenshot from the game?
idk	no to the musk or to the game?
not related to the game	are you just a reincarnation of him?
i might be writing about him for my princeton supp	is he going to be your legacy jump in?
i might not	"princeton is my backup to harvard"ok man
smh	oh
ya sure	don't share this link pls
impact on the world?	lol
hehehe	i meant like more than just express itself
but shows ur personality	super cheese
not necessarily bad	something about no nudity on youtube
u should put som punk rock	yeh ok

lol or i can talk about all the trash memes	oh that's a good one!
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh or i could stare at my computer screen listening to melancholy songs	maybe you shouldn't listen to melancholy songs when writing an essay that isn't about depression lol
:'(	my eyes are hurting from all this screen use :(
are u basically ready to submit?	lmao
ya	when are you going to go visit weedtown and uc butts?
i forget when	oh bruh

🐱	i can't prove to the government that i'm roy xing
didn't u go to the guidance meeting?	there was a guidance meeting?
lol	on the school it says john doe
so	wut if he changed his name
wdym	i'm filling out the courses and grades section of the ca
it should look smthn like that	thx bby
they will pay for it	oh wait, the art students have to pay too
u dont have moneyyyyyyy	lol
do ur parents k what colleges ur applying to	they have to pay 15 bucks
starting from page 67	did you write this?
lol no	i think it's alright
is it good / bad	maybe it's cuz i just watched an amazing 3 episodes of a magical rorm com
ok what's are the pros and cons	lolll
it also got me on an hour long googling session of go and it's game mechanics	you probably shouldn't be researching go as much as i shouldn't have watched those rom com eps
but go is sooooo interesting	btw, just curious, not trying to be a downer or anything
wdym	idk much about it, i just think about how ppl just sit there and do nothing
part of my thing is that ppl look at meditation and it's just sitting down	wait this is actually good
lol ok	so that if i read your essay
one thing i've read a lot is that admissions officers love essays that teach them smthn new	and we can see if you got your point across w/ meditation as the topic
cuz their flipping through hundreds of essays a day	lmao i'm fucked then
nah ur fine	how da fuc am i fine
well cmu will specifically be looking for it i think	"whoa guys, check it, this kid fucks"
whoops wrong one	lmaoo
it's rich choggas 18th bday	"fuck everyone _in_ this planet"
probably tomorrow or tuesday	wait a sec
i wouldn't apply if it was binding lol cuz i'm still gunning for mit	oh the second place where they made ai?
and cmu came 3rd	bitchhhhhhhhh
that 30,000 undergrad enrollment holy shit	geezus man
for just undergrads	wow
college like that are basically their own town	sounds like the perfect place to set up a cult
holy shit google's reviews of uc berkeley are straight gold	lmao
"got yelled at for walking through severl safe spaces'	or ppl who got rejected
he said hes a transfer student at ucb	geezus
ain complacent in suppressing anything that threatens liberal doctrine.an overpriced adult care care center. i'll never accept contracts here again"	geezus
e news from on the ground reporters with a reasonable mind would come to the same conclusion. i truly hope this gets resolved in a nonviolent manner."	i wonder if there are any reviews like this about other schools
lol	the bathroom experience?!
the toilet will jerk u off	lmao
all the comments defending ucb don't realy help either. they just call the ppl giving one star "white supremists" and "crazy little trump supporters"	we can even add a dildo feature for gay dudes or horny women
robo dicks 2.0	california scares me now
in terms of ur stance on us politics	do you think i really care
on social policy or fiscal policy??	what the heck is fiscal policy
economic / political policy vs social policy	i believe that all immigrants should be kicked out
jk	fiscal wise i think i might lean left then
i tend to be more socially liberal, and i stand kinda in the middle for fiscal policy	except for the bigger gov part
which is why u have higher taxes, and why the gov can be pro-worker	i think you underestimate the power of automation
having ai in congress also means they don't need legs	i mean how will the ai robots take over if their legs keep breaking?
ai don't need legs if they can take control of the entire us arsenal and all its vehicles and airplanes	too bad musky and other ai ppl told the un to ban that shiz
pshh the un can't ban that	just like chemical warfare? :'(
it only takes one ai who acquires the ability to learn on its own to fuck it all up	"ai in war will save ivies" like brown? lmaooo
but telepresence means robots are still controlled by a computer	wut you talkin' about
u can easily hack tha tshiz	telepresence and teleoperation is a person remotely controlling shiz
boom ai takeover	lol
lol	wut if you have an ai that makes those protocols to guard against hacker ai
while the guarding ai is not. if the guarding ai is also a learning ai than it could easily go rogue as well	not if we nuture and take good care of it
lmaoo	the hypothesis can be restricted
ok i should really work on college apps now	i feel
lol ya like 10 min she was like "oh i was talking about my hw, and i was 'fuck me. justin'"	i think she wants you

what if abby comes out as gay	i'm the reason behind gayness
i'm on chapter 2 rn	do i look androgynous or something :(
i'm really curious how we would differ	ooh, to compare our results?
yeee	geezus, dis wavelength
email: justinyu1618@gmail.compass:bubsy123	:o
also no commenting on the password. it's top secret	boi, how much do i owe you?
i can probably get 5 or 6 reads out of that so it's worth	lol, to make it up to you i'll tell you one of my pass, which is actually just rearranged for all my other pass lol
that's woerd	i'm into girls with blunt bangs
yeeee	lol
sarah's also on this wavelength	geezus
iq scores don't necessarily correlate with having an interesting and deep mind / personality	did you jack off to our future ai talks?...
no why u save it	it's saved in the messenger chat lol
damn	fb automatically saves all the pics
🐱	you still get all the girls if that cheers you up lol
i was thinking i might ask a soph of jen utterly rejects me	:o
probably liz	you're going to get beat up by ben
idk then	who knows how this shiz works
i might ask kat, one of my coorganizers for mahacks	what's her full name?
huang	katherine huang
idk	https://www.facebook.com/itsnotkathyy?ref=br_rs
no	https://www.facebook.com/kat.m.huang?pnref=friends.search
ya	she's pretty cute
ya and she's really smart too	are you getting the tissues ready?
she did research at harvard over the summer	geezus
ya i mean if she went to this school i would like her over jen. but we just don't k eachother well enoguh	:o
i mean i'm pretty sure, bc smh really enjoy hanging out with kat but we've never had time to really get to k eachothee	just ask her out on a date then!
i also don't like jen as much as u like abby o think	i'm over that shit alright
i don't get my banana frozen over her ;)	i even talked with her today
jeezus	hey
do u have any plans for prom?	ha
money	engineering the future
can u use engineering the future to buy botball parts	they would easily see through that lol
:'(	"why do you need to buy these specific parts from this website? can't you just use amazon?"
"whybdo all ur materials have botball logos on them?"	lmaoo
what a coincidence	maybe i'll ask a girl in our grade who doesn't have a date
nah u shouldn't, prom doesn't really live up to expectations probably	nah i shouldn't go to prom?
i'll drag u	wut if vara asks you to prom
poor joanna	wut if you just started to text kat psuedo dic-eggplant pics
i don't thinkbthats how flirting works	oh shit
fake news	lmaoo
you've finally seen the light	my hair's starting to get long again, i should stop wearing my glasses and become emo roy again
ur a cross between gym bro and emo	a nerdy gym bro emo dude
as u workout the sweat drips ur eyeliner down across ur face	lol
that should be ur common apo	lmao
holy shit in choice of robots i'm deciding whether to spend the night hanging out with friends or working on my robot	lol
this feels surreal	working on your robot
:'(	lol
go with it	alrighty
and we can compare	oh yeh, got it
🐱	i don't know who josh is yet lol
ya i didn't realize it would be this surreal	oh shit i can choose if the robot walks on two legs
wait sorry no spoilers	same
alright this is getting scary	bruhhhhhhhh
but josh had a gf :'(	lol
this game is elaborate af	lmao
hey hey no spoilers	oh right
also the chapter summaries appear in the show stats tab so u can look back on them anytime	aw shit, i'm at a crossroad rn
imagine what u would do in real life	nah wait
sure	josh raises his eyebrows. "oh? like what?" "like a robot that could be the best friend anybody ever had.""like a robot that wasn't just as smart as
hmmm	hmm actually
ok noice	alright i'm on chptr 2 now
same	shall we just finish chapter two for tonight or something
ya that's what i'm planning	nioce
yeee	i'm already on chptr 4
ya this shit is so goos	aw shit
ur robots name is angel?	if only there was an option to ask josh to make a secret 1-man r&d department
mines thrustin	yup, it walks on two legs and has wings so hence, angel
🐱	lmaoo
i don't remember this being so good tho back when i did it	it certainly is surreal lol
my two end results from back then was getting cancer and dying and my robot starting a world war with china	so you got a steve jobs ending
lol ya	the press compares your partnership with josh to that of steve jobs and steve wozniak, or larry page and sergey brin. but those would be understatemen
idk how i got here	ikr
but i crashed at marks house and got drunj	lol
did u really	lmao
*fame	wut if we just copy and pasta the surreal bits into our common app
lol she was creeping outside my window	i feel
i just got here	4th
i wonder what would happen. if i pick number 3	i didn't get that third option
damn i'm excited to compare	i feel
oh dang lol	holy shit
lol	he got even more mad when i said i want to keep the human employees since i don't want to cut them off and they're good ppl
but i chose to have human supervisors	make cool shiz for several years as the financial side slowly catches on fire and burns away in the background
idk if i should hire tammy	i think she's fine, she knows technical stuff after you just interviewed her
wow roy how donu feel about this	(i'm just trying to offer advice w/o mentioning spoils lol)
tho	*it would be funny
nah	oh then keeping it professional would make sense right
wait are u playing again	yup yup
whoo	i fought crime with the crusader
did u become a bum	nah
damnnnn	which lead to a kind of "brave new world" situation that's not as dark
*empathy	then the crusader appeared
holy shit i want to play ur timeline	this is what i currently did
lmao	lol
in this situation	ic ic
so that option doendt exist	lol
i've reached the wired in moment	holy shit
i just bought josh	why not merge?
he's an employee now	is he ok with that?
ya we celebrate in new york	nice! good terms
i was just hacked by both china and us	lol
i've been distracted by vara	i just did a quick rerun of my second run so i could screenshot the story and the bits that made me feel
damn	i kind of want to go for memey runs, oh dude, what if when we're free one day we'll just go through the game but meme the fuck out of it
sounds like my kinda friday	sounds like my kinda prom night, except i'll be all alone
also did u get the church of the enlightened thrustin	lol
i just met the crusader	yeeeeeee boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
what	ikr
who needs a gf	yeh that made me feel
yo where u at	in ur heart <3
i'm kinda stuck at the school for a while	so you're actually going to the talent show?
i'm sitting in the caf lmao	you can go backstage and cheer her on i bet
then i said good luck and awkwardly walked away cuz they went into the auditorium	lol
it's the first thing i thought of	lol
rough in the sheets and rough in the streets	geezus christ
i'm rewatching the social network lol	wait really?
maybe choice of robots	dang
it all started off so pure :'(	lol
yup	i honestly can't really think of anything that didn't go terrible according to plan...
in the spring	ouch
i mean botball rn is quite the disaster	yeh, but that doesn't exactly have a resolution
the challenge of being told legged robotics has no applications	hey
🐱	oh man
called how i got into mit	you have to pay to see his stuff
lmao hes charging $400 for ppl to see his application	this is uh
lol same	"i've programmed robots and designed car parts"
i dont k that much about their robotics	ok, i'm no longer applying to mit
they probably have a bunch	they seem to have a whole separate bunch of teams that only compete in competitions
college students usually love talking about their college	wut if i reach out to the guy who's selling his app for 400 bucks lmao
on repeat	dang dude
she was really good	duuuuuuuuuuudeeeeeeee
well it never hurts to cold email	cold email?
i wouldn't try to stalk him	lol
oh like "sending a cold email" is emailing someone you don't k out of the blue without previous arrangment	i bet it would be easier if i was a cute messy girl like tammy
i cold emailed a bunch of students for all my college visits and usually about half got back and we met up	aw man, i wish mit had a robotics department
prosthetic feet are static	i know mabel from umich were given feet, but i don't think those feet actually actually did all the functions of feet besides giving mable a bigger fo
probably cuz robots still have terrible balance	cassie only sometimes falls over
that's probably the biggest challenge to ur foot fetish design	wait, if i'm able to actually make a general purpose robot in the future can i sell the patents do you?
ya sure lol i'll be josh	*to you
but ur not gonna oversee the factory lmao	c'monnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
at least affordable so that means a few thousand dollars max	a few thousand _max_ ....
it has to be able to go 24 hrs of activity with close to 100% success	so you're saying the robot has to be able to take care of itself?
probably robots won't be used in average homes for a while. first i think they will appear in the service industry	caretaking will probably end up being mostly done by soft robotics or a combo of softrobotics + traditional mechanical systems, like an inflatable rob
janitors, waiters, grocery stock person etc.	package delivery? ;)
not on two legd	four legged
wheels	drones aren't the best in more populated areas
we already have the infrastructure for home delivery	do you really doe
nah i don't see why delivery has a need to be automated	cuz robots need employment
in the near future	🐱
lol	you were saying before i interrupted lol, in the near future?
bc politics	or the first
everyone's already piserd bc no jobs	in all seriousness though, i do think that robots will give a type of companionship/relationship that doesn't exist
especially of there's a building relationship aspect to these companion robots i speak of	nah, i don't mean you need to be "friends" or anything
ya i agree that would be the ideal	is siri a slave huh?!
but robots need a whole lot more reliability	no she's an assistant
yes	it's only slavery if you treat them like slaves
it's not immoral bc the robots don't feel suffering or any desire to be any other way	hmm
lol my relationship with juliet is still 59% even tho i murdered her	holy shit
from the beginning	your relationship with josh is pretty high too lol
 came in handy bc our relationship stat was so high i convinced him not to sell any robots to the us government when i went rogue and took over alaska	holy shit
must stop going down this dark path. this is your final warning, or i will stop you". and then there was an option to track her down and kill her lmao	was josh just in it for da money in that timeline? :'( he was so happy when he made his charity foundation in our last runs
he still made the charity foundation	lol
thats bettr than me and zeiger	zeiger must've really hated you
do u have a lot of work or smthn?	idk
samanthas voice is so soothing	lol
and then he found samantha	or did he just not try hard enough
lol	ok that's tru
#opportuniycost	that's the keyword though
so	it's instant gratification, without long case resolution
the technology worked	did it really though?
they were dating for a long time	the dude looked at naked girls in public
and they would have continued if the ais didn't leave humanity	but the fact is that the ais did leave humanity -> short term solution
idk wha at the movie was trying to do	btw, i didn't actually watch the whole movie, i've just been reading a lot of essays and videos on it or the concept lol
🐱	oh yeh, i never had any gripe about ai lol
but "resort" implies they're inferior	getting a robot dog in place of your dead dog isn't exactly the same bruh
when no human he encountered could	did she doe? she couldn't provide him anything physical or any real "warmth" the dude keeps flashbacking to his past relationship during the movie
u should really watch the movie lol	i mean he could also just be freaked out by that whole entire action lmao
but i would def try it out	lol
what do u think ur doing by being with abby all the time	i think you simply "fall"
🐱	what's wrong with that huh mr. i wanna try girls out
i think more often, u meet someone and u slowly fall in love as u get to k them	🐱
i can't imagine loving someone i don't know for a long time	is that why you went after elly instead of tammy?
tammys ded	lmaoooo
i also deported elly lol	bruh
just to see what would happen	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsfucww9zto
i gtg for now cuz i got a mahacks meeting	dayumn another meeting
we can cry about our love life later lol	i guess i'll just talk to myself
~vara	....
he sent me this right after	which sci oly chat?
officers	yeh, that was quite the something
it was kinda out of nowhere he just got really mad	well to be fair, it must hurt when everyone is on one side and he's by himself on the other convo
ya i agree but this reaction is way over the top	i also noticed everytime you and him have a little debate on the smallest things you always seem to dominate the conversation so maybe that build up o
or just him and i	just you and him
🐱	remember when we were talking about robot workers before sci oly, i was reading cassie's newest most awesome papers and you were working on ai stuff
oh ya	and then it turned into why chemistry isn't the most important thing in the world lol
ya	i noticed it too in other convos between you guys that you always dominated it lmao
well that's cuz i was defending reality	vara though plays it kind of cool, but i can see how it can get to him
his argument was that chemists should be paid as much as engineers	esp since you don't realize the real reality is that legged locomotion is the most sought after field, ppl just don't realize yet
but in the real world they're not	🐱
so no matter what whoever argues for reality will be correct	lol, yeh, but it does matter who is arguing for what though
hmm do u think i'm bad at taking into consideration other viewpts	wait, before we continue, are you feeling alright? you're not tramautized from apocalypse now or aything?
lol nah	lol, tbh idk, every time we've debated over something it gets resolved rather quickly and then we meme it
ara has trouble taking into account other pols viewpoints, especially bc he starts of a lot of arguments with "justin that's just dead wrong" or smthn	though i did notice when working in groups with you sometimes you do really "dominate" a conversation in terms of firing back constantly and stuff
lol like in botball?	or during the brief moment i worked on auxivision lol
but in my head i've mentally considered all the other ppls perspectives and still come out with mine (at least i try to)	funnily enough i think i need to work on being more like how you can rapid fire talk and stuff to be honest lmao, i take way too much time pondering w
but that's also why ppl turn to u for a cooler head	holy shit yes! i finally got an ad for robomasters
lmaooo	lol thanks man, though i've never solely lead a team by myself though so i think i still need to work on that
not bc of me tho	you could try memeing more or something
vara doesn't k what quality memes are	oh shit
i meme with almost everyone else	oh a more serious note though, some of the more competitive kids at school (i think you know who i'm referring to) do see you sometimes as a  quick to
define quick to fire back	competitive kids that we know mutually i mean lol, like wong
meming comes naturally idk how to fake it	it's not faking it, it's about getting into it
see i used to like sympathize with why that person feels a certain way by putting forward my personal analysis but usually that puts ppl the wrong way	hold on, let me buy my plane ticket to africa so i can find myself
see that's a meme from a random time that we just randomly perpetuated naturally	yeh, but we also have a flow in which we are kind of self-aware of our memeage lmao
as holding back saying "ya i get why u might get that impression, but that's probably cuz you've barely spent any time training and teaching the kids"	oh yeh lol
i hate sugarcoating shit	i mean it honestly just depends on the person
argh sugarcoating feels like lying	are you calling me a lyer  justin?!
what if i don't like how fast it is tho	ok, you're on the right path at least lol
🐱	that's not how it works you dumb fuck->ok, you're right on the right path at least
but what if they're not on the right path	ok, fine i'll make it into a mathematical function for you lol
is pretty good	lol, thanks
so technically i stopped responding	ahh
usually stemming from an argument and usually the argument is really dumb and  irrelevant	sounds like a married couple
hes having one hell of a bad day	wait, how is wong involved?...
he messaged wong at 9 saying how wong had no right to lash out at him yesterday	wong lashed out at him yesterday?
that was the pt of the argument in the sci oly caht	oh, i thought it was going to jeremy lol
vara approached wong when wong was pissed at jeremy and wong yelled some things at vara	guess i misread
its a cycle	yeh, i see what you mean
i need to spend more time out with the bois	lol
well maybe starting after jan 1st tho lol	it'll be our subsitute to the bar
but welp	ahh
i mean even since 7th grade its been happening but alwasy centered around vara	unless we're all high af on drugs or in solitary confinement
like do u k nearh	what the heck is nearh lol
its so stupid looking back on it	oh shit
ya same	oh dude, i got this great invention, it's called wired internet stickers
and the dod	sorry, i saw the chance for the memes and i couldn't resist
cuz those are all customers of accion	🐱
therefore by the transitive property	lol
wait is this still jeremy	tufts is my safety
lol ok	;)
tru	oh shiz
did u end up doing another one？	whoa
i think u just send to marelli	you can speak chinese?! :o
this is the one im sending	if you like tulips, then say roses, if not then take your thorns up to a maple leaf pile
lol is that what it was	nah, it was a lot better than that lol
there we go	lol
yup	hot dayumn i'm so fat rn
lol wdym technically	he was skinnier
u probbaly will have ur photo id pic as default	oh
its just a blank space	that would be hilarious
johnny has a sense of humor	but he also has a sense of duty
suicide sheep	the music is definitely not weab
this is some funky funk	gotta love the funk
i didn't like it at first but it got stuck in my head	the books
jeez	i got it
that's her bad habit	ooh
lol more like literal	tru
i dont think so	nioce
lmaoo	i was doin' work with sam after school
roy hardwareee	:'(
i'm not doing it cuz i k nothing about planes	they're makin' a drone this year
or uav	oops
unless they have legs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om4kfafhbjm
to help them fly like the peregrine falcon	oh tru, can't fly without legs
🐱	lol
rejected	what is 2016
for what part	oh wait
i didn't have to do that	andrew moneybags carnegie
oh is it for financial aid	yeh
u should email the colege admissions office	that's like scary af doe
ya	oh wait
theres also a whole research lab for mechatronics	wait
maybe for freshman	i can't find them
course 6 and course 14 all have a bunch of their own robotics as well	"toy product design"
"hands on marine robotics"	dat's like
"analysis and design of digital control systems"	4
cs and aeroastro also do a lot of robotics	i count like 8 in meche
and there are more i just didnt' keep scrolling	i don't count linear control as a robotics course
"6..834[j] cognitive robotics"	i count 4 in aero
smh	so mit has like
alsoo alsooo mit has iaps	25 - 30 robot courses
and everyone can just work on projects	so you mean summer?
and there are structured ones like beaverworks autonomous racecars and stuff or u can work at companies	🐱
bc its awesome	yeh, but there's the ri
roy	i can just hide in a closet when the undergrads leave during the summer and then emerge
lmao	kind of the same with cmu
and they take a while to get to the applications	not at the ri ;)
have u done any community related activities	i think
lmao	thx man
so u could too	i helped out with monagle and awvizus last year every 3 weeks or so but idk if that counts
 that their effects can continue on to many other generations of roboticists to come. i strive to stimulate the dreams of many undiscovered engineers.	did you write that??
thats damians	ahh
its not for "commoners" like stacy	is the girl in the corner who thinks she's a special snowflake and uses tumblr and hates straight white males?
bc	i'm going to refrain from reading damian's app in fear of being influenced by it
mit is a party school	lol
*soon	nah nah
lol	go stalk his office
the first uc berkeley billboard i see	be careful
and i was talking to a foreign student from the overpopulated communist country of china	is that all they talked about? d:
their ai program is great	oh, you haven't interviewed them yet?
ya i finished it	nioce
also all republicans should be deported to mexico and we should not only legalize gay marriage but make it mandatory	holy shit...
it's required	lol
if ur not gay then u must be a homophobe and a racist	lgbtqrstuvxyz
u bigot	i don't believe in fags
bruhhhh	lmaoooo
60% sure	he must've been high af
nah im in the humanitis building	ok, if that's the case
i've been in and out of meetings with students and professors	just take pics or vids plz
u can't just barge into a private meeting and just sit down	why not doe
i met with an nlp professor who gave me some pointers on my independent study	hot dayumn
then a few students, one whos foreign to get a fresh perspective	"foreign" -> sichuan girl?
o_o	holy shit, that's a lot
its still insane	that's still a shit ton of ppl holy crap
u don't really get to k professors well	oh man, idk how i feel about that
but another thing about having a lot of ppl, its really easy to find a community of ppl with similar interests	pssh
the academics are super rigorous	like i care about that
bc ur right outside sf and silicon valley	aren't the 2nd and 3rd points tru for all the colleges we're looking at lol
and theres lot of opportunities	is agility robotics or boston dynamics there?
a lot of students go to the bay area wanting to do a startup, and lots just end up doing a startup for the sake of a startup which is why they fail	oh shit, are you calling out their entrepreneurship
well not necessarily theirs but like in general entrepreneruship is a bit of fad, but most prominently  in sv	how the fuk do you just make a startup for the sake of making a startup
wait u probably were'nt there	what the fuk is online bowls lol
did i show u that vid	i think you showed me a spoof vid making fun of entrepreneurship
thats an examle	ye
robo startups aren't relaly a big thing due to the startup costs of robotics	money doesn't matter
im sure youll find someone to leech money from	hey justin, i have a great idea
u guys really hate applications	lmaoo
u just create cool projects for 12 hrs and u get free prizes if ur goo	but all the projects i wanna make take longer than 12 hours :'(
but i don't got that kind of money	you should take over the world so you can get that kind of money
ok by the time im in college hopefully i will b organizing haackathons big enough to have hardware	did you find a room to work in at ucb?
i also spilled lemonade all over the ground	lol
theres a "no food or drink" sign on the door	lmao
i've noticed that as like a wierd trend, some beaverworks ppl were also against like entrepreneurship	wait
bc they're more "startup" style and he wants to do r&d or smthn	oh wut
hackathons are only a recent thing bc computer science for the masses is only a recent thing	ahhh
i'm not friends with any of the "cs purists" from bw	lol
nah she's not	ahh
all i remember is they didn't do very well in the competition cuz they spent so much time trying to perfect some algorithms	i can't really wrap my head around why pure cs ppl won't go to hackathons, isn't it like for prototyping and stuff
and they kinda expected it to just work once they port the algorithms to the racecars	lol
without much testing	can't trust the simulations or theories
fact	are you not a cs purist?
actual philosophy majors have applications too	oh shitttt
abstract modern art, accident lawyers, and cs/math purists	wtf
wait have i not given my rant to u	not about accident lawyers lmao
 gist of it is that their ruining our democratic institutions by taking advantage of our strong legal system for personal profit, fucking society over	lol
shes a grad student studying nlp	did you find all the nlp ppl??
well shes a student of the professor i met earlier today	maybe you guys will hit it off ;)
lmao bruh	😍
cant have her seeing these messages	lol
	lol
walking through berkeley	holy shit she speaks 3 languages
i kinda dragged the meeting longer than my other ones	lmao you stud
how are the bubble tea stores?	bruh
i'm not that smooth	she's also probably way older than you lol
like not just nlp but linguistics lomguistics	she blew you a few times?
i thought she was a grad	maybe she knows ashvin
actually i think she's doing like a program that will get her her master's as well	oooh
but she said she couldn't wait to see my nlp paper	:o
so i got to write one now	lol
it won't be like revolutionary	are you going to publish it too? :o
idk it probably won't be good enough to publish but we'll see	dude you gotta send to her now
lol i'll send it to her but it will be trash	wut if you put ur number in the end of a special copy sent to her
there will be like a hidden message with the first letter of each line	bruh
wdym	i just randomly talk to ppl, not set up formal meetings :'(
and then this whole vara situation that i'm trying to just ignore and let it pass	is vara still mad?
it's annoying cuz it's illogical and usually i can just logic my way out	emotions are usually illogical
at 3 am	how was it?
i listened to my i need a gf songs	did you see a kind of creepy blonde lady who looked like a mess get into her jeep?
btw hows bois night	oh, i don't think i'm going tonight
writing my uc b application	oh shit weeedtownnnnnnnnnnnn
or flying cars	damn
i have an info session in about an hour	have you met any kool kids yet?
i'll ask about it tho	i heard that weedtown's campus is bigger than ucb even though they only have a fraction of the student population
lol mit :'(	lmao mit is that tiny??
ya bc mit is also in the middle of a city	cmu is 140 acres
and noam chompsky	cmu has andrew moneybags carnegie
pshh he didn't actually go to cmu he just founded it	apparently he actually got a degree from there lol
hey what robotics be without mit's ros amirite	lmao
thats just fake news	lol
really?	this is just a quick blurb that i wrote up:
which question is this	tell us about the most significant challenge you’ve faced or something important that didn’t go according to plan. how did you manage the situation? (
so ur talkin about night before regionals	"justin then flexed his massive muscles and got all the girls"
nah that's ben	nah this is a couple nights before gcer 2017
lmaoo what if we both write about that but from different perspectives	oh dude
"my good friend roy xing (applicant number 22232212) was also blah blah"	lol
idk about roy	should i put your middle name in lol
oh jk its roy xue	lmaoo
:'(	:o

who has the best wheels lmao	jenn's going to be my pick for most prone to get hurt
is that actually one of them	max has some nice wheels
too	i think i might end up as most gullible given the robot conference -> orchestra thing sam pulled on me
lol	most likely to travel the worldmost likely to be a billionaire most likely to be a soccer mom
ya i'll put u there	i could put you down for those ^^^ lmao
idk a girl soccer mom tho	oh shit, wrong copy pasta
i put hunter	lmao

they get id'd bc terrorists	holy shit
the doctor himself	kind of want to put down bowen and eric deng for doppalgangers
lol	are you back in the not super weedy and sunny land of ma?
im missing school tomorrow	:o
🐱	lmaoo
cuz they don't spend a whole lot of time reading since so many ppl apply	but what about holistic review
u k berkeley uses an algorithm	you mean they don't look through each app and try to get to know their applicant? :ooo
r a 'maybe' you will get an email asking for a letter of recommendation around december or january, and then 'maybes' are reevaluated with the letters	lmaoo
where	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2i-fcx8lzw
lol this is too long i don't feel like watching it	basically he just says he has "special circumstances"
what are his special circumstances	i don't remember
except none of the stanford students agreed to meet with me lol	lol
try new stuff	hey, don't shit talk me
i'm really getting into linguistics now a lot more than o realized	when you become a novelist call me and we'll have a crazy drinking sess
linguistics is actually super computer sciency	"you should try to branch out from robotics roy"
but it's still a very broad field that mostly doesn't overlap	maybe i'll end up pioneering a new field of art
dynamic sculptures?	kinetic sculptures do exist
ya ik	but they don't "move" enough if you get what i mean
that could be ur branch out lol	simple turns and twists
so u can't really move much	most of them are windpowered
minus all the legal ramifications and stuff	the government just doesn't understand tru art
it has a lidar on it	holy shit
california hotels have some crazy shit	is it cuz of the start-up atmosphere and innovation stuff?
probably lots of startups do their beta testing in businesses around here	i still can't believe there are people who make startups
failing is probably the best thing to learn from	but isn't failure garuanteed if you're whole vision is the idea of the business itself instead of the business
ust randomly pick a startup to do. i'm saying they want to solve problems but don't spend as much time as they should in the whole formulation process	ooh that makes more sense lol
bc there's already way too many social media apps	what do you think about the westcoast entrepreneurial scene?
theres a lot of really cool groundbreaking startups tho and a whole community of investors and incubators supporting that	like willow garage amirite :')
d have some connections. but in order to scale if i do get a startup off its ground phase i would go to the bay area to look for more investor backing	damn, you have this whole thing thought out huh
well i mean thats just a plan right now. it depends on how the future works out	so did you plan for the part
aka the big c	where i come crawling to your door since i'm out of money and my apartment is starting to smell
can't start a company in boston if i'm stuck at umass amherst :'(	oh wait, so location matters for you?
but boston >>> pittsburgh	how are you going to do ai if you're stuck in harvard hmmm
mit, stanford, harvard, cmu, ucb, buzz	:o
also i can take classes at mit	ofc
lol ill make the decision when the time comes	when you get into all of those 6 schools
especially not mit or stanford	who knows man who knowss
it might be one of the underclassmen	i'm betting my money on you tbh
it might be eric deng	was that a whole setup for a shit meme
lol thanks roy <3	lol
are u applying to stanford?	if they don't pump out an impressive project soon i probably won't touch them
thats why they need a new young roboticist to come in and make a change	is this a subtle way of telling me to apply to stanford lmao
they ask some deep questions with 50 word maximums and then the long essays are so broad	yeh, i finished compiling all the collegio's essays and shiz
as a person who has read both waht do u think	i think your entrepreneurship one flows better/is more interesting to read, not in terms of substance, but in terms of structure and flow
so it would be shorter	what is the most significant challenge that society faces today? (50 word limit) oh man i could meme this so fucking hard
lmao	the stanford supps are just asking to be shit on
lol u have school tomorrow lol	in your og one it tells more of a story and or experience so it has a nicer flow while the meditation one feels a bit more like an explanation and des
thats what i was trying for for the meditation one	that's probably personal preference though tbh
oh wait all of them	:'(
even their really obscure songs are pretty good	yes yes
damnn so the shoulder joints are on a ball and axle? that turn and look at the camera was pretty cool	bruh
lol. i was bored. these kind of videos are pretty fun to make so if i´ll see something i consider funny i´ll upload it! :d	"mm-hmm"
it was pretty great	does it count as racist?
amost	🐱
lol probably	i'll turn 18 w/o ever being on a date
famiy guy is racist anyways thats the pt	;)
ur so olld	:'(
thats really disturbing	it's by the 20th century painter, francis bacon
i bet an ai can make something better	but where's the history
good thing that won't happen	really, you like weedtown now?!
stanford was really cool. their symbolic systems program is mmmmmmm	🐱
its literally a whole department dedicated to ai	oh, so it's like the ri, but smaller?
its actually super cool	damn
they just don't have as much of a dedicated ai program	wut, but the ppl in cali r hot
but it's just they're ai classes are not super diverse i think	and their robotics isn't as good
robotics isn;t a real field	:'(
and pretty much #1 at computer science	cmu
lol	i might watch you burn that scarecrow next block btw
oh gym?	yeh, d's not here
are u just outside or inside	oh wait i'll be in a room next block
it's a small scarecrow	how was ur sacrifice?
and mrs. pickett led us in chanting	hot dayumn
hymns from the netherworld	occultists now
im stil confuzzled	oh dude, i just got back home from volunteering i need to finish that
im suppose to be watching a presentation but im doing physics hw instead	yes i volunteer lol, the ppl were really nice, i-i feel this strange feeling in my heart
so we could call then	lmao sure, we can suffer together into the night as physics slowly kills us
no its an entrepreneurship program that i mentor at	oooh
but same organization	ahh ic ic
🐱	:'(
are u ready to call?	oh yeh sure
yeee boi	but just feeling bad
which problems have u done?	i've almost finished intersection
ok. i haven't done #55 yet so let me just attempt that one first before we call	you finished everything else?! :o
well no but attempted everything else lol	oooh
ya ready?	yeh sure
 you called foxy roxy.	i'll forward you the pics from lulu btw
saving these bad boys for nights like this	oh god
yup	i'm a fucking coward
no i don't think so	ah shit, should've stayed
but now i can't beat u in smash	"i should probably do work now"
true, i wouldn't even have to work to beat ur ass	🐱
that would be not ok lol	duuude
but u guys message so much	what do you mean
i thought u meant abby	oh nah, we became friends on fb like 1+ year now
she kept asking me how to do it lol	all good programmers know that when you're stuck you first go to stackoverflow before you talk to real ppl
but it didn't help her	wut
i got annoyed cuz she talks about how she really into cs and founded a club about cs and shes doing like introductory codeacademy shit	maybe she's just a slow learner
so she probably likes cs cuz its like trending idk	maybe she just wants to impress you~
ok preferably big brains. but its not all about big b's ok	lmaoo
of knowledge	jeezus christ lol
idk anymore	do you guys only talk about school and what you do now?
ya she stopped sending dick picks	awww
nope	darn, online shipping costs too much
yo	yo
are you good with doing circuit lab for sci oly	wait, i thought we were building today
building what?	the build events
whcih ones	getting started building the frames for mouse and mission
wait whos gonna be building?	me and anyone who's brave enough to help come cut wood with me in my basement with a jigsaw
i think your the best at circuits by far	wait
its always a thing in ma	wasn't circuit lab taken off this year?
i could do circuit lab but i don't k that much about circuits	tanishk and i just finished up building
how far did u get?	got the pieces cut
also fcuc had another successful meeting	fcuc?
food clean up club lol	ooh
they shoved a while bucket of pasta at me	lol
r is the author of "barking up the wrong tree." in this video, barker explains what it takes to be a billionaire, and it isn't a high gpa. --------...	is that tru or just supposed to make ppl wanna click lol
but it's on the internet so it must be true	have you ever had these like slump moments
wdym	i've done nothing for the past 50+ hours
maybe we shouldn't have given u those cold ones	i drank all of them
holy shit did u actually	i might go buy some more later tonight lol
so what's up?	i don't have enough materials to make anything new
think haarddd	lol
it's not good to stay in the same room for too long	yeh, i should really go outside of the bathroom now
ya....	wait a sec, maybe i could use this emotional crisis to make good art
lolol	that i will then post onto tumblr
u can sell it for millions	maybe i'll just pick up litter from off the streets and then 3-d a human skill
oh btw are u coming this wednesday?	oh no, what's happening to me, my hair has been shaved on its sides, i'm growing a shitty mustache, and i'm wearing a barret! i'm becoming an artist n
check the bois chat	i only watch true movies with the full artistic intent behind them, arthouse movies
damn	maybe i should take this as a sign that i don't have the drive to actually want to go to any of them
the main thing is their class size is too big	i've been biased too much by the ri and boston dynamics i think
also i kinda meme the liberal culture there but most ppl i've met are pretty level headed and also u can stay out of the politics if u wanted to	oh no worries lol, i don't care about the politics or whatever
but also there's only one "why ucb" question and u don't have to choose it	alright, i've decided that i'm just being a wuss and get over being down
yee boi thats the spiriti	aw shit
unless ur sure u k what ur getting urself into	wait, i don't have enough money for carbon fiber springs
lol	can't do the bipedal robot :'(
fire gauntlets ;)	lol
also fire can somehow break through several feet thick of solid rock	i forget about that lol
we could even do a robot, i can program it's intelligence :d	bipedal robot revival?
meh we can worry about that later	oh wait
its young trakimas	holy shit
ya that's crazy	why aren't we like that
in 60 years ppl will look at my yearbook photo	lmao
what a hunk amirite	lmaooo
like in general?	i guess so
shes basically still a freshman	lmao
giggly all the time, kinda acts dumb but she is pretty smart. shes kinda flirty a lot of times. kinda what i would think of as a typical freshman girl	oh alrighht
lol whyy	not sure tbh
o_o well i think shes also kinda cute-ish like physically but i'm not attracted to her whatsoever	alrighty
wow	jk jk
wait can u ask why she wants to k first of all	sure i can, once you tell me the secret to stop attracting lesbians
is this out of the blue or part of a larger convo?	a bit more out of the blue
jeezus	🐱
they're always together	dude, idk how this stuff works
actuallly i think i did see a bit of that dynamic among the freshies	that they're all insecure about ppl's views on them?
btw i can't think of a senior quote	"oh sic"
but thats a bit too memey	mine was"legged robotics is viable"
was it actually	yrd
ur realy committed	it'll be why my future wife divorces me
lmao	idk, i just felt it had a nice mix of memes and actually what i believe in
if i were to get it from a figure that inspires me it would be musky	i'mma google elon musk quotes
~elon musk	lol
"i would like to die on mars. just not on impact."	lol do these apply/say the message you wanna convey?
“my family fears that the russians will assassinate me.”	lol
ya that was part of the book i read about musky	i'll let you sleep in my lab
but they're not inspiring, the content is pretty inspiring but they don't sound inspiring lol	the quote doesn't have to be funny, you just have to like it lol, unless you wanna meme
lol	wut the heck are these quotes lol
lol i don't think we're next to eachother	aw man
~ oscar gamble	wut
or its just super poetic and no one gets it	"i don't create companies for the sake of creating companies, but to get things done"-muskydamn musky
what if i did the girlfriend one	well you better hope there's no girls from whs going to the same college as you lol
but he also makes things with applications tho	:'(
“you never lose a dream, it just incubates as a hobby.” larry page“it’s very hard to fail completely if you aim high enough.” larry page	"the path to the ceo's office should not be through the cfo's office, and it should not be through the marketing department. it needs to be through en
yea boi	oh damn, those are some good quotes from larry page
ya dude in interviews he talks about how he spends most of his time alongside his engineers doing engineering problems and how he hates business shit	hmm, maybe i should've said something more inspirational than "legged robotics is viable" lol
also check out this video roasting jeff bezos	who is jeff bezos
he's notorious for trying to put his hands in every market	ahh, he sure is trying to put his hand into robotics, but it doesn't seem like he's expanding beyond factory based robots
lol easier said than done my man	i'll die and be forgotten on the streets :'(
jeff bezos is more of a business guy while musky is more of an engineer	"i prefer salty snacks"
he's a really good business man	ahh
lol idk if i will get into robotics	it's ok if you don't want to make a robotics division
hes talking about doing a startup	is this from musky?
what part do u not agree with?	like for example, ppl with low self-esteem would be damaged by following that advice
ya but would ppl with chronic low self esteem be able to make it in the startup world?	hmmm, the only path i can see rn for me creating a company is to create something that no other medium would allow me to like academia or military
ya i guess it just applies to startups	yeh i suppose so
also "it's ok to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket"	btw since you're actually sending one in now
i think that ones pretty funny	i should probably tell you that max was able to get johnny to agree that if you forgot to send one in your senior quote would default be "oh sicc"
like quantum computing would have a huge startup cost definitely so i wouldn't be able to do that as my first venture most likely	hey
hardware	but spacex and tesla is all hardware
to be able to fund those two companies	i think marc raibert got bd off the ground with military contracts
meanwhile there are rich ppl sitting on fat stacks who spend millions on empty air pieces of art smh	that's it
lmao	so step one is to get rich
"here is a legged robot""mmmmm nah""it has no real world applications!"💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵	lol
sorry had to generate a spicy meme	these memes are too spicy for me :'(
wdym?	how did he build a creepy ass robo that is not commercially viable
he had a shit ton of money	damnit
in the movie he basically single handedly founded a better google	welp hot damn
but ya	first you need money huh...
*most internet services have been fulfilled	so you're saying software startups need to have a way higher standard to even launch
there's just too many ppl trying to be internet entrepreneurs. web dev is so ubiquitous and easy to learn	so pure software companies won't appear anymore either?
writing code is just too easy	is that why a lot of hardware companies are popping up now
idk if that's a trend	though two of those aren't really profitable lol
idk about bd	i think bd is actually from the 90's :'d
idk about hardware companies but there are still tons and tons of software "companies" being churned out and usually it's just a website and one dude	so the software startup scene is just overly saturated?
ya	ahh, then how do you propose to break through that with ai though
i actually thought of this before i saw her but then i realized its very similar after lol	what the heck, wearable ai?
i think wearable tech is a pretty promising field	like ai that's constantly around you? but instead of on your phone it's literally on you
google glass failed bc u need cultural adoption before anyone would wear a screen in front of their eyes in public	not going to lie, when i think of wearable tech my mind goes to exo suits and ihmc's robo exo legs for paralyzed ppl
if u have a device that isn't super visible thats always around u	google glass also failed cuz it looked fucking terrible who designed that?!
i actually got my wireless earbuds to test out the idea of having something around ur ears all the time	wow, that's actually pretty impressive man not going to lie
which part lol	though if you want ai with an earpiece that's not unwieldy looking physical computing size and capabilities have to improve first
ya true	the reasoning behind your wireless earbuds
:'(	your best computer rn for a prototype would be a pi zero with wifi
which i don't k how to do	well what do you want the ai system to do, general purpose ai hasn't even been made by researchers yet and it seems to be a rather academic endeavour 
did u look over the enka grant?	hot damn
did u go home?	yeh i'm at my house
th planning on starting ur uc	oh yeh
i visit their schools and ask their students why they like the school	well hot damn man, i don't think i can do that lol
ya he probably likes it there	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yevnacmtw
"no emotions (gay)"	lol
just like knee socks	hot dayumn
looks so different	wait is that actually him?

what do u mean	you should like
what	i've been watching too many rom coms
ya i agree	and that alex turner video
lol dang	i will never be able to relate to that line
what	it's crazy
dang all of arctic monkeys albums hit #1 in uk	lmao, so much for indie rock
i skipped them in the new arctic monkeys playlist i just made	too much emo for you to handle lol?
am and favorite worst nightmare are their best work	i find that it's a lot easier to write college apps with arctic monkeys
lol	u know
whats ur current list?	just umich, washu, buzz, mit, cornell, stacy (maybe not even stacy, but the amber lab is there >_<), rpi, wpi
not ucb?	oh, i'm doing that rn lol
ok so 9 schools	but depending on how dec 15th goes i won't be applying to any schools
u don't have to do that prompt	i can't think of anything for the other prompts tbh
robotics?	wut u mean
are u gonna do robotics for the academic subject	yeh
these prompts are sexually harassing u	thx man
don't even mention an engineering major	whoa really??
lol ya	are they like amherst college then?
:d	isn't that just
yup yup yup	lmaooo
she doens't k yet	ahhh ic ic
i don't think so	but i thought she wanted to be _just like you_

lol	i ate all the cheese
thats not too bad. mine was about multitasking so	i can edit it for you if you want
i need yo make it less shitty first	maybe i should start the rest of my college apps..
same	wait, but even after dec 15 no matter what happens don't you still have to apply to cmu #2?
so really just stanford	lmaooo
lol	what five words best describe you?
argh i was suppose to start working on ucb at 2 lol	cracking cold ones with bois
 hackathons if u never been to one" and she said "oh i'll go to a few before april, and i know we'll like it cuz all of us like programming and stuff"	lol
ya it left a bad taste in my mouth	btw, do you know if any stores are open rn? i'm the only one in my house until tomorrow now and i need some cold ones and arctic monkeys to set the mo
wait why are u the only one in ur house	folks went out, told me they wouldn't be back until 12am

wdym by stuck	it's literally the same screen
oh	but all orange
lol	it's been like 10 minutes now...
but ya it's annoying	i fucking hate gaming laptops
to dual boot	...
is it still frozen	yeh
welp	should've stayed away from gamer laptops
lol what if u find on stack overflow that specifically "powerspec computers can't dual boot ubuntu"	how hard is it to just make computers that don't suck window's dick huh?
lmao wait can u choose another similar value computer with the waranty	idk
probably not	:(
wait what did u do	oh my god
🐱	and it worked
is it that what u wanted?	i wanted to install on ssd and then save files and stuff on hdd
welp	alright alright
also of u get it u can help me dual boot when i do it xd	of course of course
lol	it's another gpu manufacturer
noice	i fixed everything now
and december 1st	oh nice, that should be a far less grueling time
lol hopefully	wait, what are you going to use the dell one for if your current one is more powerful?
oh btw i have some time tonight so i'm gonna watch a movie. what should i watch?	birdman
hmm	blade runner
is it like an old movie	it's from 1982
ok	oh man
lol ok thats what i want	wow, hot night huh?
thwg	...
how does it feel to face ur future	🐱
she'll be bipolar	lmao tru
t and caring side will be on linux, then when she's on her period she turns into a naggy windows hellbeast that screams at u to update her every nigjt	lol geezus man
roy only wants you for ur legs	lol
"you better have your love life sorted out or else that would just be sad"	haaaaaa....
but their hot	lmao nice
cuz she can't code	lol
nah also a girl that is like wicked smart and insightful. i want to be in a relationship where i'm always learning new things from her	sounds like you wanna be in love with an ai
ion in her life and has a life goal. we would both pursue our life goals in support of one another, and we could shape eachothers goals for the better	what if she's a communist
ahem jen - "i think i'll jsut marry a rich husband in the future"	lol, sounds like you have a history with this
cuz her family is former aristocracy in korea so apparently she has "connections" to marry some rich businessmen if she wants to	wut
like me	think about all the funding i could get
ok technically but thats from the late song dynasty	dayumn
and do art i think	wut
they'll fund your projects lmao	all the funding i could ever want, without having to write grants
lol thats actually pretty ironicly backwards these days	exactly
it doesn't exist	wow
ya but i mean marriages get stale for a reason	neither of us have been in a marriage before
btw what if my senior quote was "no roy, it really isn't"	holy shit, that would hilarious
🐱	did you submit one yet?
nope	bruh
they said it's fine to send in whenever	wowow
something about patriots	lol
:'(	lmao
u can share urs with me, i'll probably edit it tonight when i get home from this asian thanksgiving party lol	ur at a party?!

did u read my trashy essays	yeee i did
ok servin up some spicy memes before i start workin	holy shit
so bad	bruh
ya instead of making fun of diasbled ppl im making fun of little hispanic children	lmaooo
good luck	you too
namics’ video of a humanoid robot executing a backflip sparked a lot of dark humor, and now billionaire elon musk has responded with dark seriousness.	bruh
all i have to do is ask it to be mailed and then stand in front of the bd office to grab the mail	imagine if that's how you actually buy businesses
lol	a freaking update just ruined everything
damn	ashley's wondering where you are btw
oh ya my accion boss told me about that	too bad i don't have a rubber duck
i can talk to khloe turd sculpture	lol
ya u should	well, i may not be able to use that graphics card rn, but i do get a longer battery life :')
im so dead	wut
and then prepare my mini-lesson on crisis committees for mun tomorrow	geezus
oof this is the pt where my hand starts reaching for the caffeine pills	maybe you can ask your mahack partners for some help?
plus they don't get work done and i need this work to be done asap so	it's really starting to sound like you run mahacks by yourself lol
btw did u see my digitized version of the practice board and scoring rubric for botball	wow, that's impressive
f my team members pull their weight. and techcnially i don't have to do all the wrk i'm planning but i think its necessary so i'm putting it on myself	"two of my team"
versus if u didn't have to crack it open	sure, but the kids are going to think we're actually insane, obsessing over cold ones so much
its 10:30 and i'm already having late night thoughts	ok, i'm going to contact some companies now to ask how they installed ubuntu 16.04 to be compatable with an nvidia gtx 1070
🐱	🐱
🐱	man, i really want to just sit down for hours and just use ros
2nd semester	tru, gotta hold out until them
actually after january 13th which is mahackd	i guess using the backup gpu for now isn't _that_ bad, it's not like i'm using anything super graphic intensive anytime soon...
lol ya u don't need nvidia	should i like be on call on pi day?
cya	u at the school rn?
why	i was in the back lol
i would make sure it is	fuk, where do you get that info?
wdym	i can't find it on naviance
why do u need quarter grades	it doesn't go back that far
u should have gotten a transcript from guidance	cuz when you make ur app they ask for your grades lol
u also only need year grades, not quarter	but that transcript only has final grades
i only did final grades	this is weird
we would probably have to miss last block	hmm, time to be bad bois and skip school?
langlois won't care	what block is that?
illiant. some work extra hard to keep up. some (like me) make the right kind of friends and learn from them. and some, like my friend, are organized."	i'm still pretty confused by what the context is behind this story lol
and i thought the last bit was interesting	well if anything is possible at mit how come they don't have a bipedal robot yet?
🐱	i feel like the mit media produces a lot of useless things
we'll have to see. i haven't opened my computer yet	time to attempt to dual boot, drink a bunch of cold ones in frustration or celebration, and then cry that we're doing this instead of hanging out with
i have another devoce to fuck up in a few months	lol
lol u can see my old comkputer in the back bsod-ing	lmao
it's becoming more and more frequent	ahh, perhaps it just needs a new os?
lmaooo	what's some essential stuff to get on a smartphone?
oh wait u have a smartphone!!!	too bad i'm not going to use it outside the house
didnt u take it to school tho	never taken it outside the house lol
seeee the usefulness of a smartphone	i used my laptop for that one
lmao	just submitted
lmao	thi is just fb
yup	i wanted to try to use my dad's katana
that would have hurt	i just used a kitchen knife instead
asdkdlfhalskdfhlkajsdhflkajsdhlkfjahsdlkjfa	what happened?
just had some healthy bouts of anxiety	cuz of mahacks itself?
ya just organizing mahacks	maybe you should get a bit more harsh with your team lol
its just a lotta stuff	ahh
ya	is everything calming down now though?
i think so	nice nice
i think the mit media lab makes useless things	it wouldn't be creepy if bros tagged each other in "guys who will become dads posts" since then it's shit meming
those things came out of the media lab	didn't the government make gps doe

ok. can u work at the school then? i'll help u bring shit over	i guess it's a good excuse for you to get gains
also random meme	luckily we're not really "adults" yet
well u are	hey hey
?	ah nvm lol
ok	tbh, i've been mad rattled that cmu hasn't finished their side of the financial stuff yet
uh	some ppl are having nightmares about being shot or killed in a war or border and i'm here like
would u still be able to go if cmu gives  nothing?	yeh
tru	^^ this is one of the spicier memes from cmu
lmaooooo	for some reason
i don't think so	nioce
and if i get into mit i don't have to worry about financial suff	i meant for other schools lol
plus they already have money saved and shit to pay for my college	dayumnn
what school would u want to get into if dec 15th doesn't work out	you mean like dec 15th turns into a complete and utter rejection?
hey look roy cmu's acceptance rate jumped to 63%	wow thanks man
wanna skip school and come to this with me	it's 195 bucks to attend man lol
if i get arrested it would still be worth it	if you don't have a badge they will kick you out dude
nope	alrighty, she was gone so i took the chance to leave
lol	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0az4nhlzfc
"buttered side down"	ikr, gotta keep an eye on this quality content creator
maybeeeee	geezus
(vara)	wa wa wa, how could you tell so quickly?!
i usually just don't participate in the gossip	(this cat has become so useful in expressing sarcasm or memeing in this chat lol)
i'll just let him word vomit into the chat and hen in the end i'll be like "cool. ok gtg"	ahh
dude i tell him that all the time but he just gets mad when i do	feelssad man
but he wouldn't listen lol	he talked to me about stuff like that too just recently, some other clubs too lol
lmao	i had no idea that you could do that
can u just tell him that its not healthy to always be talking about other ppl	this all makes sense now
and not to freak out	he's offline lol
oh i thought u were talking to hi	but yeh, i can leave a message
wut	shouldn't have gotten a stupid smartphone, bugs everywhere
lol	though idk why they can't just give me the same number
u can just do internet calls	front desks and other services don't do that yet though
ur using it to call cmu	yup yup
haha u fuckedddd	that they're having a problem with financial stuff in general
ok that's good	or at least that's the cover story they gave me
@_@	https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/humanoid-robots-photo-contest
hey u k i just read that part for hamlet today	this must be a sign
there is a 3 min gap where the red line is	did that 3 minute left-on-read trigger you lol?
lmao	personally, to me it's not a big deal
psych	ayyy
wait but what conditions the response	maybe he's only like that to you lol
idk why	perhaps you just illicit that kind of response from ppl lmao
no	http://cmuportugal.org/tiercontent.aspx?id=5914
but how will u have the materials	you see
🐱	since when did mit have great resources for undergrads
since they hand out free $$$	:(
wasn't that literaly dammian wanted a new bike	that at most would've cost like 100 bucks
for himself	i thought he wanted to modify his bike to have leds and shiz
lmao the money is suppose to go towards new projects or initiatives that enhance the mit community or dispaly creativity	an led bike that spelled out words or sentences as you rode on it
ok but to be fair i don't think cmu would support that idea either	yeh, of course they wouldn't
it looks like they used all their funding for that couch lol	feelssad man
but i'm sayin individual projects	nah nah, they help you with your own individual projects apparently
fake news	lmaoo
what do u think	it doesn't
http://roboteam.mit.edu/index.html	they only do competitions doe
full of individual projects as well	i thought that was like a class lab
do u mean the school gives u a bunch of money and u just do whatever u want with that money	yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
you would be a great cro one day	i'll hold the world record for most bankrupt companies
well i think most robotics at mit happens through robotics groups or through project based classes	yeh, idk how i feel about that
really?	nah, at least i don't remember us talkin' 'bout it
so mainly the hacker culture, everyone seems really ready to get down and work on cool projects	i mean i can piece together it myself probably, but ya know
the academics are obviously top notch, the research programs are some of the best, especially in cs	sounds a lot like no applications to meh
but mit also has a lot of entreprenuership	"see what happens"
theres so many entrepreneurial resources here	ahh i see what you mean, yeh it does like a perfect fit for you
and ppl at mit are pretty artsy-nerdy too	hey hey if you wanna talk arts i'm ready to fight
arts and architecture #1 ;)	the school of arts at cmu is ranked among calarts
ya but cmu has nerds and artsy ppl	mhmm
what i mean is mit nerds are not like caltech nerds	they dun release da numbers alright
:d	ohh shit
hey #3 arts school in the world amirite	but then how come all the brad engineers come from buzz
also mit's entrepreneurship and management program is also among the best in the world	they keep saying arts but they never specify what art lol. it's like saying best science school
architecture!	is that it
cuz the media lab does a lot of things for graphic design and ui/ux	but steve jobs made the computer say hello
i mean mit invented ai amirit	lmao
i feel like ben	lol
i'm also in mit rn	wut
bc i feel like it	the nhs meeting today is mandatory lol
so	bruh
and pshh but i'm going to an mit event tonight	can you sneak into mit cheetah lab for meh pls
pshhh mandatory my ass amiritie	what's the event at cmu#2
it's at the media lab, it's a showcase for local startups	so not robots or so
🐱	that was sam
thanks sam	you there the whole day?
wut	🐱
litty lity lity litty	wut
ya	who gave it
i'll tell u later	i'm really debating on whether to skip nhs now
his hair is so long now	:o
lol he kinda starting to look like beegee boi	i told you!
ex-gf	oh......
he was talking a lot about his he's grown a lot at mit	ahh that's good to hear
#breedingground	jeezus justin lol that might be personal stuff lol
actually maybe i shouldn't talk about that	if he's alright with it then it's alright i suppose
lol	our second year into college imma ask you dat
pshh u k the answer	🐱
i wish	lmao
nah i'm back now	they didn't take attendee
damn	ah shit i forgot a lib pass
lol wut	i'm in an am mood ya feel
im always in an am mood ;)	emo told me
oh shit	emo time
i've been feeling so unproductive these days	yeh, i feel
u can be just like damian!	🐱
bc i'm subscribed to a bunch of ai newsletters and such	wutttt dang
so i can't go tot he whole event	ahh, is it admission for only one person?
i could send it to u if u want lol	oh damn...
*gmail	<3
did it work?	i'm writing an essay in drama rn lol
<3 <3 <3 <3	was this maddie?
ya	do we need to grab anything for sci oly from my house?
like all the materials	wanna do some lifting with me?
rn?	ye
lmao	wait, does that mean you were going to come but now you're not? lol
for the meet	i can't lift all this stuff by myself lol
oh woops ya i'll be there in a sec	not sure, i kind of wanted to work on the build events rn
how many ppl do u need	i think 1 is enough
ok i'll be there in a few	we joked so much about colleges, mit cmu stanford
ya....	it's going to hurt so much worse now on dec 15th
i think it's pretty interesting to see what parts of the app she pays attention to	you meme colleges with vara too!
lol vara can't do memes	awww
we were just discussing like our hopes for college	ahhh
🐱	is vara super set on harvard
ya	ahhh
he's really freaking out about it	ahh
cuz like at this pt theres no pt in being stressed	i feel
so not like his safe school or anything	i hope he finds out about how cmu's application actually works soon then :o
ya maybe	tufts is my safety
i've definitely heard of that show	it's kinda creepah
*itself	awwwwwewe
damn	any new sad songs that you can recommend lol
i've been listening to only one who knows a lot	damn man
ya...	it's perfect
do u wanna see my melancholy playlist	yeh sure
	if you send me dat gay song search doe lol
damn i missed a prime meme opportunity	🐱
wait where does it show	on the top under your name
wait i don't see it	maybe it's an iphone thing?
lol i guees	alright that's enough feeling sad while being in bed
this was me and rhea's first message conversation	lol
and it was mainly me crying about how we don't get money :'( but we have a lot of cool ppl	lmao
:'(	i kinda want to watch that weedtown vid and i kind of don't want to at the same time lol
its actually quite interesting, i would def recommend watching before u submit weedtown's app	was one of them a stem asian boy who doesn't do sports lol
xd	holy crap
tru	man it's really annoying to think that all these college apps i'm working on could just be wasted time depending on dec 15th lol
and unable to write	hmm good point idk how i'll react
sounds like my harvard app	lmao
are there ay other factors about a school besides their robotics program xd	....
like design?	any form of visual art
tho one of those is #1 ;)	and i'm not talking industrial design
u can probably apply to gtech pretty passionately right	more of the artistically design
buzz is so underated	stupid public smh
nvm	lol bruh
eeeek	first part?
its mainly biographical info and ur cultural background	oh lmao
probably so they have a record of how many applicants they might get before they start trickleing in	oops
but u can leave it blank if u want	hmm
holy shit	good times
this where i'll be gping	graduation rate: 5.6% (2014)
there's a whole bunch of 100% acceptance schools	damn boi
i just found it funny that there are 100% acceptance rate schools	perhaps they don't get a lot of applicants
jan 1	oh wait i forgot about the interview lol
oh that might be jens person	ikr, if it was a robo person i would only talk about robos and then i might tragically mention how great the ri is
i'm not sure tho	ahh
my guy never responds to email	oh dang
does this ruin the song for u	i wasn't listening to mariah carey's xmas song lol
lol no idea	holy shit
that's worse than me	now whenever max pokes fun at u you can just reference this moment and feel better lol
it's ok we can be fatter together	and then after jan 1st
did u end up getting the tickets for ai world btw?	ah shit completely forgot about that
actually im not sure eeither if i will go	lol
 you called foxy roxy.	good thing i'm already used to rejection amirite
we're going out for cold ones tomorrow	nah, got more collegio apps to write, gotta use up any angst that might be a'comin'
plus gtech matches you	lol, nah, no need for the comfort talk, thanks doe, i'm just curious about the hard numbers now
cuz didn't u say ur similar to sayak	the rest of my app ppl have said it was great, and whatever. the interviewer even said i'd be a great fit, so the only part that was lacking was the n
when applying to college, correctly doing your gpa calculation is essential. use the right data, and correctly consider weighted vs unweighted gpa.	i know this is bad to dwell on but i just kind of want to know what part of my app made cmu say no, so i can keep that in mind for other places lol
was it a rejection or a waitlist?	let me send it to ya
hmm ok. they did offer for u to call them	not like a sadness for it, but rather it just makes logical sense to me rn
yet got into uchiago	wat
its a pretty big crapshoot	🐱
and one rejection doesn't indicate much	do you know what that ms:rd means at the bottom of the letter?
no idea	the only thing i could think of was that's the name of their master's robotics program lmao
cuz they do write notes on each applicant	ah smart
what's ur goal school now? buzz?	yeh, buzz's robo labs are more spacious than mit's
which schools were u thinking of applying to before?	i'll just think of each school equally now i suppose
which one do u like most of those?	these meme names are helping take the edge off a lot
wait we don't have one for umich	i mean it's pretty easy to sort the rest of the schools by their robos lol
have u tried calculating ur gpa based on the college way?	each collegio does it differently so at this point i don't really want to lol
i think it would be healthy if you took your mind off of it for a day or two. crack open some cold ones with the bois	hmm, not sure, there's a lot to do and not much time left
that they would def take more ppl if they could	aw shit, i still have that interview with mit girl on wednesday
honestly if u wanted to i can ask my mom to help u practice cuz shes done plenty of interviews	nah, it's alright, i'm just going to say what i want like i did with brian lol
ok	i would practice more if they were old and stuff but lydia browning seems like a hip young millennial
thats good	oh man, i kinda don't want to do interviews for all these other schools... but it might help right?
and their robotics program	she seems to be from the architecture or design doe lol
hey jeremy	🐱
what work are u doin?	i just drank a second bottle of cold ones
welp	just feelin' defeated
u can test out that new arm hang	have you done the weedtown app yet?
nope	wanna join me on this endeavor? lol
lol sure.im not currently home tho	where u at
we can grind through it tonight	"i study industry standards in robotics such as robot operating system, opencv, which is an advanced library and framework for computer vision in the 
what question is that?	i was jokingly thinking of adding that to my activities page on common app
so we have gatherings	"what five words best describe you?" -weedtown app
srsly tho i don't think it's good to write apps in this mindset	did you just drink enough cold ones that you feel like you're going to throw up
that's good ya	exxxxtraaaa coldddd
ya and i'll be free after 5:30 if u wanna talk	oh boi, i kinda hope that no one hears about this
imagine what would happen if vara got rejected from harvard	ah
oh did max tell u about star wars next sunday?	yup yup
ya i figured	maybe it's wrong of me to think like this but i have a strange suspicion that everyone else's response would be the same
hey u wanna see a primo memo from aadhya	idk if buzz is my next top choice now
that's probably healthy	here, let me air a dirty little secret
cmu was never meant for u	lmao, all the actual legged robots are either in specific grad labs or industry
it might be even worth it just to go to wherever agility robotics or a similar company is based	agility robotics is based in pittsburgh
oh fuc	thx man :')
wait i thought it was a washington company	jk jk
phew	they have an office in pittsburdg
🐱	🐱
this schools only help u if ur not sure and would like to enter a variety of induatries	time to apply to calarts
🐱	i've actually got a lot more vigor to write these other apps now i notice
what's the irim	it's buzz's ri essentially
i don't think u should judge it solely on one very specific thing bc ur inevitably gonna change ur focus when u get to college	that's why i'm asking sayak about other stuff lol
i talked to one of their organizers on my visit to gtech	hey hey
right now?	sure if you want
alright hold on lemme get my computer	i'll let you call then
 you called foxy roxy.	i came up with some good ones
u should do it	my apps are so behind lol
your already ahead of most ppl for regular decision	i'm starting to think i'm quite the bland applicant now lol
u have to give it a different angle	ah shit i lost track of time
we just finished	*planned to go to botball, fuk u atucorrect
btw did u tell max and ben and ethan?	noperino
oh. cuz it sounds like they k	sam ernest and bowen know now lol
oh ok so ya	the smart bois they probs figured it out
oh nice	you wanna have scheduled college sesses? where we just edit our apps? i think a structured schedule will keep away the whole "no place is as good as t
max and ben are just worried	btw i just reorganized my whole drive, just shared it with ya
ugh max and ben want to come anyways lol do u not want ppl in ur house?	yeh not rn at least
when do u wanna do them	what time u free my man?
i cam also do wednesday night's or tuesday nights	alright sounds good
also are you planning on reapplying for cmu regular?	i'm going to call them tomorrow if i can reapply _just_ for meche in engineering, i'mma beg and cry
but dietrich! :d	i already emailed them today and they i could do that, but i'mma get vocal confirmation tomorrow
nice	nah, it's harder to transfer to engi or cs if you're from dietrich
woops that was so much worse	bruh
u liked cmu bc of her personality	lol, nice backpedaling, thx man
im so good at comforting ppl	but i'm losing any flow lmao
lol that's fine, its probably better to write out what u want than restructure it	i actually like weedtown's questions, i really wrote a lot for that one
i should probably get started on that	let's be real here, a 3.9 gpa guy like me has no chance at places like mit or weedtown
ok maybe not weedtown if u don't feel it but mit	you actually want me to apply to mit?
i mean theres so mch emotions invested into the college app i can kinda understand why some ppl might be mad	hey, how about we make a quick baking blog and youtube channel?
final boss meme	truuu
how did u just realize that today	i just had it stuck in my mind that cmu had the most resources and was the only place that allowed that
this is what happens when roboticists try to force out applications	feelssad man
oh i found a new song thats pretty catchy	yeh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_426riwst8	is it going to have crazy ass lyrics like that last song you showed me lol?
psh not tht crazy	damn, you're really into rock huh?
even a 3.51	that 3.51 was a rich athlete and we know it
before polcari i thought mit didn't care abotus ports	division iii school>cares about sports
🐱	maybe this isn't healthy but i was thinking about reapplying meche even if they say no
i mean u could and its not like they would be able to tell	i know this will sound really arrogant and i can't believe that i'm still hung up on this, but what part of my app did they just think "nope" to...
ya sure	i need this shit man, then i'll be off the hook i swear, just one more hit
i would try to show that more in the essays	thx man, it's good to hear from a close friend
np. i just tried to tell u as straight up as possible lol, i don;t mean to be brutal	nah, it's perfect
ur humanity needs to reach at least 80% and ur have 20 in empathy	but my human side is weak, i can't show my vulnerabilities
lmaooo	yeh, i had a similar suspicion so i started to inject some of my more artsy ambitions into my apps
the mindset is that you can always teach ppl to be good at skills, but u can't teach a person to have a good personality	damnit, so don't say buzzwords likei know the industry standard robotics operating system that are used by professionals and some of the most advanc
basicaly tie all ur experiences to specific character traits	you fucking genius
🐱	lol and you thought you were too technical in your writing
well i still kinda suck at creative writing	you must have some experience though right? didn't you also want to publish a book?
ya i liked creative writing as a kid but i was never very good	ahhh
ball toss?	yup yup
ya	i'm just about to start it lol
lemme k if u need anything for the lab	alright, thanks man, let me know if you need anything
probably on wednesday night tho	ooh, that comes out tomorrow?
yup	alright, i'll buy you some cold ones
i'm not really stressing about it rn tho i feel like i should be	those lines sound very similar to what i said not too long ago
:')	also that feel when you're "too cookie cutter asian" but the clearest fix would be to be black or hispanic
if u put a random race on ur app	our names kind of give it away though lol
jk i just made that up	and if they call you out then you can play the "you're questioning my race?" card
"this is.. this is sexual harassment!"	"i"m not exotic"
although there are a few scientific studies and arguments that i think are valid, in favor of affirmative action	like wut
same	a kid from the projects should get a boost compared to a kid from exeter
i think affirmative acion based on income make sense	maybe when we have influence we can advocate for that
https://www.xavier.edu/mfi/documents/steele_claude_m.stere.thrt.inafrican.am.tst.perfm.1995.pdf	holy shiz, 1995?
this was an interesting study (i didnt read the whole thing, just a summary)	what's the sum all 'bout?
thats the results	lol that chart looks hand drawn, that's kind of funny
whereas if they are told its not a measure of intelligence, black and white ppl perform the same	has this been replicated though?
er potential than they appear while white and asians would be performing at their peak performance, or even higher bc they are stereotypically smarter	after reading a lot of papers on robo claims i've learned to be doubting with results lol
ya, stereotype threat is a pretty accepted thing	hmmm, not sure how to deal with this new info yet
so that proves the results are due to cultural stereotypes	so you're telling me that the liberals are right?
not so much about the whole not having ur economy collapse tho	let's hope that autonomy solves that problem ;)
lol that's probably a good idea	i wanted to continue to edit
are you in school today?	ye
?	die
uh	not gonna lie i spent a lot of time just reading on reddit or college confidential about other ppl getting in or being denies
well o guess everyone's just competitive	they don't release stats on early
fuck	what's wrong?
that sucks	oh
oh no i just read ur msg	i thought you meant something else lol
r u busy rn?	it's all right, it's not the institute that makes the roboticists, it's the person
can i come over?	lol sure i suppose
i'm at the school and just finished circuit lab	vara just stopped by too lmao
i'll be walking in like 5 min	kk
 foxy roxy missed your call.	y u call meh
got in	:ooooo
holy	congrats!!!!
my parents are calling al the relatives	this better not be an elaborate meme
lmao	alright, heard from max, it's not an elaborate meme lol
yeeeaaaaaaaa	wooohoooooooo
do u k	i know
wait so deferral?	idk
:/	he figured it out by asking other ppl lol
massive cold ones	now he says he's triggered at me for not telling him
i didn't message him or anything before	alright, apparently he's calling you arrogant rn, not trying to stir drama, just wanting to tell you info that you would probably want to know/keep in
lol	idk lol
so its ok	hmm, enough of this negative petty shit though, can't let a hot one ruin all the cold ones
i'm still out with the fam	holy crap, that's quite late!
i'm glad to hear it	love ya justin
there less sappy	"you're gonna kickass on these new college essays">>your dream of legged locomotion indicates that you're a retard
lol	so are you just gonna do weedtown and mit now?
which means o have more time to help read over ur essays lol	awww
do u mean in person?	oh ur choice lol either is fine i think
same	wait really
nah it's in arlington	oh wow, that's quite the drive
but my mom will be working from home that day so i'll get a ride	ahh
cya tomorrow	cya
yo what lunch do u have?	i got second
welp	did you hear?
so did nico barlos	wowow, harvard sure loves winchester
lol brandon / the junior are currently probing everyone	i don't know who that is
i told them	nioce nioce
and stuff	to be fair i also only looked at the legged locomotion field lol
nice man	aaron ames is from ut austin
🐱	what'chu doin' my man?
doing the written part of the webassign	lmaoo
nice	let me know if you need anything
this is the ramp one	i also put ff = 0
ok	where u at
i'm going home to get changed for my interciew	oh man
class of '59 lol	lydia is apparently 30s yrs old lol
lol truuu	you can also ask about his first gf
thanks!	what can i buy with 4 bucks at starbucks
a straw	you coming back for towers?
i just finished the interview	lol
well lemme see after we drop the guy off	awww alright
hey if u come to the sci oly meet ;	lol
no we're actually short	but howwww
how'd it go	went well i think it was like my last one
he didn't really ask me anythng	really???
lol	lol
hopefully	i think jenn is also mad at me now lol
? y	i talked with vara and i told him that some stuff he said might've offended ppl like jenn and now she told me he's ranting with her
after what i sent u	wut
ugh ya so he unblocked me about an hr after the first message, sent a rage bubble, then blocked me again	lol alrighty then
no, ur just the most shallow person on the inside and i hope that you really do end up going to harvard, because otherwise ur just being such a waste.	wait i didn't mean to do that
yup...	you sacrificed a lot
like ok i kinda understand the first message, hes mad and stuff sure. but this def crossed a bunch of lines	sorry lol just saw a good opportunity and wanted to cheer up the atmosphere
and then this	well he was true to his word
thats just so fucking toxic	you better lawyer up asshole, because i'm not coming back for 30%, i'm coming back for everything.
lmao	did that help cheer you up?
not viable	:'(
tadaa	u got meh
lol thanks roy, i'm glad you can always come fix my hardware	<3
bc its unhealthy	it does seem like a toxic relationship
lawed and do contribute to the toxicity, but i feel like its mainly vara's inability to control his emotions, or put friendship first over competition	since when are you toxic lol
thanks <3	i believe he also has a different view on friendship right!
kinda a bad argument	ngl sounds like what david would say lol
xd	lmaoo
there have already been multiple points where i've thought about that	it might seem "correct" to try to stay friends but trust me when i saw sometimes some bridges are just too far hazardous to repair
but its always been that it will definitely hurt all the clubs we do, which will negatively impact other ppl besides us two	oh man
ideally i just want a working relationship	is that girls feel like when they reject us
lololololololol	lol sorry just got a bit too real for meh

but jen isn't talkng to me for some reason	she's mad that you apparently let her cornell news slip?
she never even told me what the result was	i don't think you should get hung up on this kind of stuff though, esp now
oh lol	idk when she got annoyed at me i just went radio silent and things turned out ok
and i could tell she was a bit annoyed at me bc shes hostil whenever i talk to her but idk why she would be pissed	are you really hung up about this?
i guess i shouldn't be	nah, it's alright to be hung up about a friend not talking to you
but like i don't even k what the heck she's mad about and shes hostile everytime i talk to her	lol dun worry that kind of stuff is subjective, i think you're a good friend
so meh	i don't think i've ever seen you like this
ya sorry for ranting. all this drama thats going on is rubbing off on me and making me into a little drama fucker	nah it's alright lol

got rejected by colleges	nah this isn't about collegio

lol in an mit admissions blog they literally mention that kid and how they rejected him so ppl shouldn't worry about having too may accomplishments	what if they just rejected him to make an example of him
damn ultimate powermove	i wonder what they are looking for
but u have to always link acheivements to personality traits, or else they won't really care	tell a story yup yup yup
or food blogging about chickens in french	oh god the memes
:'(	just run your own bakery

meming so hard rn lol	it hurts and soothes at the same time
lemme k if u need anything	<3

🐱	dear god
16	16.04.3 lts?
and ya	the different flavors are just used specialized ver of ubuntu
ah ic	it's like trying anal
i don't think anal is lightweight or pretty compatable with packages	you don't know until you try it
u might want to get to first base first	yeh
oh i thought it was eye contact	eye contact during anal
preferably not in the gutters	apparently there was this one girl in her senior quote
btw if u say "his murder", does that mean him being killed or him killing someone else	how could the internet lie to me so
like for example "shakespeare describes hamlet's murder"	doesn't that just depends on context then
oh ok	btw if you say "her anal" does that mean her being analed or her analling someone else
anal isn't a verb u dingus	no it is
its either an adjective or a contrived noun	i anal, you anal, we all anal
i think ur prnouncing it wrong	"siri, do you do anal"
roy get back to work	"i'm sorry, i'm afraid i don't have an answer to that"
ok i need to get back to work too	that could be the mouth
stop	🐱
can't even do anal	this is getting more and more weird
roy ur really wierd	i wasn't the one who turned it into fucking phones
hey i just realized we don't have a meme nickname for umich	congrats!!!
nah no school is too wholesome to be memed	we don't really meme buzz we meme other schools about buzz lol
ppl just seemed normal lol	"normal"
everyone's doing projects in the basements	ouch
that they use for promotional videos	lmao
lol	i noticed that the mit maker videos that didn't make the cut
ya well that makes sense	some or rather a lot of the ones that got rejected had really high production value though
and they will only judge u on those main idea snippets	"french food blogging"
don't forget she also went to vietnam sometimes	main ideas :')
i'm just chilling at the school for a bit	haaaa

i just go finished making quizbowl questions	you can if you want
ok	wait, you don't think the script has an arc?
arc for urself	you mean stuff like the journey of making these robos and how they affected me?

how dem apps going	unmotivated lol
sammmmee	wanna try to have a college grind sess tomorrow?

that visit ever	the last time my relatives visited was when my cousin were touring colleges
oh	gotta love them drinking sessions
my parents are family friends with like all the asians in other towns except winchester	are you going to be ok though? the deadline is coming up real soon
ya nothing a little cramming can't solve	"tell us about something that is meaningful to you and why. (100 to 250 words)collecting data?"
(i'm currently hiding from socializing with my family friends)	if i take out that boring sentence im just at the word limit
lemme k if ur ready for some editing	you can edit any of them if you feel like it lol
oh ok so ur essays are all ready?	ready for editing

idk how to do that	ayyy
and she showed me a bunch of horror stories of rescinded applicants xd	how can i withdraw my applications after being accepted by my early decision college?you must directly contact the colleges to which you have applied

*same	so dual boot collegio sess on the 27th?
i might be leaving tomorrow morning for mandatory fun and won't be back until 27th but i can leave the mic in my mailbox	nah nah it's fine

but tomorrow we can grind	it's never too late into the night
but ya ill come tomorrow	<3
oof roy can u give me some motivation	here watch this
lmao	still need motivation?
but the moment has mostly passed	do you need a gf?
mahacks just stresses me out a lot	🐱
yes	allow me
ya i saw that	what happened at mahacks?
and all my team members are all also doing college apps	i believe this is what is known as "worrying too much"
ya ikik its completely stupid i just get these moments of intense stress and i like can't do anything else to take my mind off it	he isn't even working that hard he's just crying over weeb shit
but aren't there other organizers for tri-m that can take care of it	neither is sarah either lol
i'm confused as to when whos talking xd	🐱
🐱	there, now you know who's talking
wait	if you're over worrying then take your mind off of it
i still got a lot of work and the worrying is justified 😭😭😭😭😭😭	i think you should get some sleep first
hi sam	just go to sleep bruh
i mean roy	🐱
hi roy	did you finish weedtown and mit yet?
:'(	at that point i think it's better to nap and wake up early with a fresh mind
ya true	quality over quantity
i decided to make some memes	fuck you
yes	why u do dis
this was good for my soul ok	tru
lol ya cya tomorrow	what time you wanna grind time prime time

i'm still debating about the challenge question for mit	still???
and i'm taking a break from mit and doing stanford	ahh
in their words "it sounds like 'this happened, and then this' but not really a challeneg"	ahh
whereas if i did overcoming social anxiety it would be more just me	you can't mention mahacks in your portfolio?
do u think social anxiety would be a compelling topic?	depends on how you spin it
t's also not something that i figured out a solution for. i just forced myself to mess up more in public and the more i messed up the better i got lol	isn't that a solution lol
oh	welp shit then i better rewrite my essay lol
her essay was about working with someone she didn't like for volleyball	i think you should write about what conveys more about you as a person
eh i'll see. i might just draft one for social anxiety and see what happens	nice nice
btw how many days did we stay in dvaids basement for gcer prep	not sure
oh shot i hope u feel better	it was from summer vaca start to 2 days before gcer essentially
no it's in my what i did over the summer	but i couldn't really think of a "solution" since technically we still failed
lololok	if you need me to read over anything i got'chu
all of them?	nah
cuz i feel like if ur sending them soon i don't want to give u doubta	you can read them if you want lol
actually probably less tbh	holy shiz
nahhhh i'll be fine	alright man

or what's penetrating who	hot dayumn
just like college apps	grad school doe
fck	wait are you looking to grad school in the future?
maybe eventually after failing my first 10 startups	don't worry, if i become the cro of some company i'll spend their money on investing in your company
not suure why it sent 3	triple da pus
tho ppl like eistein dont need to go to a good college to succeed	i wonder if i can be like him in that aspect then
ya u should sleep	you know wat, all these bd and agility robotics ppl didn't go to bigass schools
🐱	🐱
from the stanford common dataset	those lying motherfuckers
yo roy can you read my first two long essays for mit and tell me if you thin ktheyre good?	which one are those
community and the where i come from	i meant which essay is it lol, there's so many pieces lying around and idk how to tell them apart exactly
lol	i think i actually mentioned you in my interview now i read this essay of yours lol
oh lmao	how you seduced me with "robot arm"
🐱	i like the community essay
wait thats no longer part of the essay	bruh
yay	it's probably just me but with all the build up near the end
ya but i was tryna to not be too cheesy and say "i wanna change the world"	i'm the guy who told josh to fuck off and then tried to build the next most advanced robot in the world in my apartment
yay	i can't think of any other way to say "i wanna change the world" without sounding cheese
well i put it on hold until ashley reads it, which she is going to tonight. today i was just working on stanford	i just saw the extra hour one
also i'm probably not submitting a maker portfolio	"performing their favorite chopin piece that i’ve been practicing. i’m getting fat gotta hit the gym"
dude stanford will love that shiz	"oh shit, this guy hits the gym!? not many ppl do that!"
nah. cuz my ai ind. study isn't far enough to really add anything	🐱
and they don't take source code	they don't???? then what the heck did damian do lol
so the only way to show what i've done is to video tape my program running xd but i don't think thats super exciting	i thought he said he linked them to his github
idk he just wrote about it i guess	what?! just showing the program running isn't that exciting?! wat
ya he probably did but they explicitly said somewhere they won't look at source code	no wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
my app doesn't really focus a lot on my own personal side projects anyways, its mainly about big initiatives so i don't think it will have much effect	how the general public views tech entertainment:program running on the terminal < program running on the terminal but with visual hacker effects < s
lmao	actually scratch the flappy bird one
do u wanna read her essays?	yeh sure
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yiw9zk4oa38hcyuy29r7bc5qz2rllhcu3hhklxx_agu/edit?usp=sharing	hot dayumn, you already have them setup to be your eduardo?
and nah they can be my josh	lol
those things are fricking expensive	truuu
wait so di du already submit?	i just submitted olin
lol	just the act of submitting takes a lot longer than i expected
nice!	you doin' alright man?
and no probably not	kinda just wanna see results come out now
it's almost slacking time	maybe i should've mentioned it was only 2 minutes so they know it's not long
wait what was this for	oh god i'm psyching myself out
and whether u did or not won't change the admissions decision anyways	tru
and ya i'm doing fine	idk i'm dumb and watched a video about how amherst college ppl do admissions
u just have to pray to r&njesus	i thought all of them would be more knowledgeable about each applicant instead of one dude and the rest just looking at your numbers
ya some schools have 2 readers	and shit i just realized i never sent my ap scores lol
u should do that right now	ehhhhh does it matter that much
weaaakkkk	fuck weedtown those dank ass mofos
well actually since u self report them i guess they will probably trust u	alright i'll send not my ap chem lol
oh lol	i'll just send them i suppose
🐱	why they wanna let collegeboard take all mah monies
dude just ask ur parents to pay for it	nah just in general
and there's a section on mit	ik on mit
i mean it's always better to	ughhhhhh
ns in a college admissions office? check out more awesome buzzfeedblue videos! http://bit.ly/ytbuzzfeedblue1 music silent pursuit mystery train lic...	ayy
oh well	i think we need an algorithm to control the world
tho algorithmic bias is also a thing	shhhhh
smh smh smhsmhsmhsmhsmhs	lol
lol	do you know mr. burke's phone #?
should be on ur common app	it's not doe
bruh i'm pretty sure it was required	both his email and his phone are blank on mine
lol ok	you have his number??
🐱	pls stahp
okee back to college apps	same

poor looks	"oh no i'm the leader of too many things what a conundrum"
youth cities	ooohhhh
dude honestly i wish e-sport recruiting was a thing	it's going to be a thing by the time we're 30 :,(
frickin polcari and soccer, well i'm a boss at sandbag soccer :'(	lmao

not sure	when mit tries to get their sports up
lol damn	🐱
what happppeend	idk
have u already submitted evyerhting?	not mit, buzz, nor cmu rd
due feb wut	yup
btw can u read over my challenge essay for mit?	lol sure
mmate, and entrepreneur.smiling, i left our second event with the unshakable feeling that, along with mahacks, i too, had grown “bigger and better.”	i like it
hey that parts not readyy yetttt	the ap part seems a bit out of nowhere
oh well its an additional info section so i'm gonna put a bunch of things on different topics for clarification and stuff	careful doe, they can only spend so much time on each of our apps so shoving a wall of text in their face could dilute some of your other stuff
ah ok	last sentence i meant
so idk if i can fit love of learning anywhere else lmao	i thought you said that part had. i word limit lol
and the learning was like a side thing	i guess the core of what i'm saying is that if i didn't know you and i read that i would want to know more about why you did that. cuz anyone else cou
ok lol i'll see about fixing that	i guess i'm at that point wondering if i tried hard enough
ya but thats also valuable	instead of doing something more benefactors like reading up on documentation
im saying if u had spent ur break time reading documentation instead of just sitting back	it's not about college anymore, i'm starting to wonder why fetch broke why the turtlebots algorithm is jankyi'm starting to just wonder if i'm one o
ya there really isn't meaning	thx man that was super reassuring
y just what goals you want to set urself onto. creating meaning is creating meaning -for urself- right so as long as u think its meaningful than it is	yeh
but the second one is my selfish drive, the first one is my selfless drive and both motivate me a lot	i used to think that since life has no meaning that makes life so much more meaningful living itbut now i think it's more about since life has no me
(unless u want funding)	🐱
🐱	i say all this but i still don't think all creations are equal from even conception to realization in the real world
i should to	maybe i'll put this convo up on my wall lol
this person sounds pretty scary	that girl sounds like a no no
:o	it says that person stays in a towel for up to an hour
xd	holy shit
lol yes but this guy isn't very respectable	hot damn
the comments on college confidential completely roasted him	did he get in?
it didn't say	damnnnnnn
he was posting his draft	that's quite the roast
ya damn this person is like extreme david but creepier	lol
it so funny in how out of place it sounds	i wonder if that person actually wrote from the deepest part of their heart
btw how did u format ur mit activity list?	one sec
oh ok	are you close to being done now? considering you know
i might add a bit more to the additional info	lol
and the rest of mit's app is so restrictive	yeh it really is
i'm putting that as my description.	lol
gotta have that sap	funnily enough, i actually did a similar thing
wait in ur activity section?	yeh
damn boi 40 words	i gave the shortest summary of botball i could lol
ouch that would be kinda bad cuz i wrote an essay about it	lol
lmao	lmao
wait what were ur 4?	is that going to be my downfall? :')
paper and papercrafts?	ppr from sophomore year
was that ur internship?	did you know i was in your bio and chem class?
i thought u worked for aptima	i made a paper in botball remember, and then presented it lol
ooh that kind of paper	ppr stands for paper
cuz like what did u put for the hours and weeks?	da fuk is a scholastic distinction
awards / distinctions	oh truuu
i have carefully and exhaustively studied the mit application form since 9th grade	that's uh
like 10th grade	wait, how many weeks does sci oly take place for lol
im not obssessed	yeh, that helps your case a lot bruh lol
i said 36	alrighty
for all my clubs	really?? isn't botball a lot more
oh for botball i did 38	we don't do botball for only like 2-ish months lol
and i added 2 weeks for gcer and extra meetings	alright, i'll put 38 too then
in weeks	how about we just settle on 40
i forgot that i had actually counted them before as well	so 36 or 38?
38 for botball	kkkk
i tailored my description to feed into my app essay tho	oh, i was going to be a bit more memey
lol ya sure	and talk about making 20 dollar shit in my basement
cuz of all the basement days lol	lol
it worked for a while until i burned out	lol, maybe i should change how i organize my things/time then
also it makes u realize how much time we spend just walking or eating or talking	i consider my personal robos as free time
ya getting audible has been so helpful	i was also estimating with 6 hours of sleep
i was kinda crazy in jr yr, no wonder i burned out	wat
🐱	are you freaking insane bruh
i would always schedule things up to 2 am, estimating my wakeup time to be 7	bruh
i'm only scheduling up to 1 am now	wow
actually funny thing is what got me out of the burnout was the gcer cram sess this yr lol	nope never burned out significantly
how many hours did u put	oh wait
wait wut	i'm saying your summer hours shouldn't go over like 100 hours max or else it'll be unrealistic
ah ok	dat feel when you realize all you do relates back to robos
thats not a bad thing	"robotics isn't viable"-google
🐱	pressing that submit button is actually so nerve wracking
are u doing it now?	i'll do it tomorrow at 11:58 pm
lmao	alright, all that's left to send is mit...
my additionl info is at 1300 words wtf	lol
i found out when i clicked "save"	oh did, you click the
but it still didn't tell me what the limit was	yup
i'm really not digging mit's website right now	that's either some hard core trolling or a grievous oversight
🐱	yeh, it's really strange how their website is laid out
xd i think i'm gonna keep it	you look like a nerd
bc mymit has been cutting out random words from my paragraphs	really?
the deed is done	congrats!!!!
thx	idk why i'm doing this
are u done with submitting?	still reviewing mit
the w is trippy bc some schools have 5 or 6 or scales	6?!
it's more about the rest of ur stuff	wait, i actually don't know if our gpa's are weighted or not
wdym	wait, the gpa's they show us on our transcript is weighted right?
what's an unweighted gpa? how do you calculate an unweighted gpa? find the definition here for your college applications.	welp shiz, should've applied to a 70%+ school
whereas our school has a as 3.7	welp shit, our uw must be pretty low by default then
they don't send ur unweighted gpa to schools	you sure?
like remember the meeting with guidance?	yeh you're right
bc prolonged panic is impractical for survival and no panic will kill you	thx evolution
🐱	"i submitted my common app essay but realized i had a large space between paragraphs. will this be bad?"
auto reject	trying to figure out what to do...
well i feel like quadrepeds are slightly easier cuz balance?	yeh they are
do u ask	looking for the next thing to make
you'll be fine	i'm not actually sure how to spend the rest of my day lol
hey hey wanna write my stanford app for me	holy fucking shit
im doing the last question	alright, i'mma help ya
but i'll let u k when i need editing	i'mma read all dat juicy unedited paragraphs
i'm not going to school tomorrow ntw	wat
senioritis is hitting so hard	aren't u done doe
ya i wasn't able to finish stanford cuz i was out most of the day doing family stuff for new years	wait wat, you didn't submit weedtown?!
it's due tonifht	oh jan 2
woops	bruh
i'm planning on submitting before ashley leaves for chicago, around 3 pm	nice nice
i'll go workout tomorrow instead	bruh
or are u in class rn	i'm working out rn lol
lmao	i typed that while doing push ups
jk whenever u have free time just hmu pls	you can send it now
istons of the great universal machine. although i have only one pair of hands, the power of learning has extended my reach 2000 kilometers into space.	imao actuator
i hope those english majors know what that is	🐱
anything i should change?	the pair of one hands
wdym by expansion	cuz it doesn't directly tie back with the learning part
ok	though i doubt you have the space to expand
but i can cut down on some places	yup yup
like emphasizing how bad my own code is :'(	lol
maybe i should just scrap it and list abunch of computer language	since you're talking about a professional satellite in space lol
*i'm excited to learn bc of how many languages i know! so many languages!"	🐱
ok anything else?	hmm not really substance wise
not yet	alright i'll just read them all anyway
for my extra hr prompt lmao	what did you do?
lol	wow nerd
oh but can u read this and tell me if its too wierd:	that's one of the most wholesome things i've heard say
tum computing late through the night. at stanford, i want to build meaningful friendships forged by our burning curiosity and shared love of learning.	this is stanford not stacy dude
also stanford ppl call themselves the "nerd nation"	typical nerds don't talk about male nipples bruh
holy shit	idk, if that's what you're actually looking forward to at weedtown then i think you should put it down but if it was more to show quirkyness then perh
oh really	that was my second reason not to mention that lol
wait did she get in to stanford	pretty sure she did
🐱	so there are bounds to be multiple kids looking for something to write about that mentions that
i have one more question left which is the event in history	did you mention q computing since neither of us know anyone who does it lol
third is getting involved in their hacker community, treehacks, but thats less of an "experience" and more what i plan to do at stanford	idk if i was going to be brutally honest with you i thought your og one was a bit basic
ok	baking
if u have time	kkkkkkkkkk
not yet	bruh lol
i'm trying not to box myself in	i saw the ahmerst admissions video
but i do think i get my pt about stem and entrepreneurship across, especially with my activities list	"this girl is a bit too much 'in-the-box,' let's vote" -> no hands raised -> "waitlisted"
ya i remember that	alright, ms hession said she can write a rec for me :')
nice!	hmm, i kinda liked carlson's doe, eh too late now
u saw carlson's letter of rec?	nah, but carlson said it turned out well
oh	and plus if what petty said was true about our recs looking similar
that i converted into my new common app	"modern hacker culture encourages flashy projects with no real-world application beyond the 24-hours of their inception"
🐱	da heck
lol wait what does a historical event with appplications look like	the wright brothers making their airplane lift off
why do u need to see it	you're fascinated with rocks in the shape of a triangle?
like i wouldn'tr eally get much from the experience	tell that to me when we see atlas do a flip irl and have the broken pieces smash into our faces
maybe seeing how woz and jobs came up with apple, that i would learn from	jobs: "woz, i'm going to take your machine and kick you in the balls"woz: "ok"
🐱	however, everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
lmao	the last episode was from like 2005
ignore that	25 - 13 = 12
did u really think i put that into my essay	nvm, you're over the word limit lol
wow	🐱
ok	lol i see you put highschool as one word
well they're not useless ;)	pls nu
overall	hmm, not really
hmm ok	i personally actually really like the woz n' jobs one lol
i feel like i wouldn't learn anything	i'm talking about him making an "o" face and saying fuck yes lol
ah screw it the admissions officers are not gonna overthink this lol so i should probably stop overthinking	when jobs tells woz about how great it could be and woz is like "meh idk man"
did u read all my essays?	yeh i read all of them
ok	are you going to submit after you write the history one?
woops	lol it's alright man
with the activities section	bruh
like there's not reason not to if u think u worded it the best way in a previous app	tru
theyre dumb	or they're just shotgunning as hard as they can lol
nah i don't think it's strange	i have a really hard time wrapping my head around it
just like u want to work for bd	lol, i wanna learn from them
u can't do that if u don't have money lol	hey hey, fuk u
and google and microsoft work on so many things they can probably have a good range of choice	back in da vinci's day you had to be an artist if you wanted to be able to be an engineer now it's more like you need to be an engineer to comfortable
yup	google let go of so many robo places lol
wdym by clumped together into one entity	maybe it's cuz i value the product or creation a whole lot more than any name or company lol
🐱	i mean, would you rather make your own company or be stuck in google for the rest of your life?
y work for google if i had the chance, but i would probably quit and start my own company after i think i've learned what i wanted from the experience	you know what i meant by stuck lol, just staying there
i mean whatever i find will accomplish my goals, i'm down	so that's why i don't fully understand ppl who just want to land a job and stay there
oh well some ppl just have different goals	i guess it just boils down to ppl having different goals and stuff
🐱	that sad feel when jobs couldn't keep his family life remotely happy
he married his first gf that's really wholesome	and then he fucked eduardo
also elon musks personal life is pretty shitty too	i mean the dude seems to have really strange ideas on how relationships work according to people's accounts who have been close with him lol
ill be a miserable anti-social eccentric but hey look how many industries i'm revolutionizing. also my ego would still be relatively in check	and you'll still have your bros lol
truu	all the bros but no girls
i could buy infinit cold ones with that moneu	lmao
but i would also make sure u got a confirm email from all the achools	gotta love awkward confirmation systems
yoyoyo u wanna read before i submit?	lo siento i was asleep lol
im done done done done done done	congrats!
i forgot ur not done	🐱
that's probably a good idea	holy shit i just spent 2 hours on college reddit threads
bruh	how do i stop this
work on some robos?	this is freaking my out lol
watch some porn	i think i'll go study
or that	🐱
its normal thing to do	just like puberty?
🐱	🐱
i still need to do english hw but i've procrastinated the shit out of it	i feel
^link^	🐱
🐱	r u in school today?
yup	holy shit
that defeats the purpose of a skateboard lmao	no it doesn't
who needs workout clothes	bruh lol
i'm in jeans lmao	bruh
i just wore what i was wearing lol	lmaooo
first impressions amirite	buff buddies
yeee	u at the gym rn?
 you called foxy roxy.	sorry :'(
oh waijt r u actually comin	if i finish before like 2 am lol
bruhhh	you had pretty good gains doe
u done with rwdc?	nope
tell everyone i said hi	lol
well we just kinda got on the topic of botball	but why didn't jenn and i get informed
wdym?	the post on important info
can you read the officer chat one if you haven't already	nah but it was strange to just have it pop up w/o much opportunity to go over it before it getting posted
cuz we all agreed on this since way at the start of the yr right	wait why are you typing so much lol
we didn't really come up with anything different	do u think i'm mad or something lol
lol u sounded pretty put off	🐱
lol well i'm pretty sure jen is pissed off	plus i trust u guys judgement
about what part?	sorry if i sounded mad lol i'm just really tired
(this is mainly to jen)	nah she just feels as if she's been put on the backburner ever since she said she want going to gcer
well we tried to schedule a lot of botball meetings around her schedule lol	she meant in terms of group making lol
but she hasn't said anything against the groups that we've made which has basically stayed the same since months ago	also if i was mad i'd be a lot more serious than a freaking chat msg lol, that's weak sauce
btw is there any chance you'll come to max's house? or no	er it's getting pretty late lol
the "experienced team" instead of the "main team", but thats mainly bc we felt she would have a muhc bigger role if she were on the "experienced team"	ohh
*ya np	i'll have to excuse myself lol
oh what time would u be available for a call tomorrow?	awww
about botball	idk i think i'll be at rwdc again tomorrow lol
so maybe u guys could call together lol	oh ic ic
ya it's kinda sad	yeh...
plus i think times of struggle really show who ur real friends are	it's unfortunate that that's how it tends to be
but apparently she was super pissed at me before for random reasons	oh then idk
lmao	not gonna lie
lol no	no to cover up or?
no one else knew but i don't really mind	ahh
nope	bruhhh
dude idk why u even joined	i said i could help them if they needed it
bruh u could of just said u would help but not be on the team	i'm pretty bad at saying no and thinking of ways like that
"hey kid can u help me bury this dead body"	"hey kid if you shoot this guy you can join me in making robots"
oh are u still at rwdc lmao	yes
have fun :d	maybe you and jenn can bond together by working on rwdc together
no im good	alright
nice!	are you sure you don't want to make legged skateboards?
but we should talk abotu what we wanna do for our senior project	ok
🐱	drones are boring though josh
🐱	founds like some liberal bullshit to me
actually an ai drone would b super cool	what would it do though
pterydactyls	drones aren't exactly the best platform for manipulating its environment
but drones def have a lot more maneuverability then land robots for mapping environments	slam'ing on a drone is extremely hard rn lol, not many drones exist that can do that
maybe it doesn't need to perform a whole slam but some kind of positional tracking and then object avoidance might do	then i'm sure a camera, imu, and several ultrasonic sensors would do then for really crude positional tracking
well the target might not be in view	yeh tru, what would the drone do when the target gets shot
it could be something more hardwarey bc this would be mainly software	this may sound like quite the twist
project that can test some kind of bigger concept, and if our shitty prototype ends up actually working it has the scalibility for a longer-term thing	did you just talk business
t is wearable ai, but the hardware portion is mainly jsut dependent on being very miniturizable, which is pretty much impossible with cots electronics	hold on, i need you to translate that into binary so i can understand what you just said
there ya go	i mean wearable ai i think is still possible with cots parts, it just won't be comfortable lol
the magic of online text to bin converter	but the ai part will have to very good if we want results from that though
i gotta go do my english essay tho, but we should keep thinking of ideas	i wanna be cfo
wanna just make a google doc and each of us can add to it when we think of something	🐱
🐱	yeh sure
ok sweet'	btw, have you seen jibo?
the home robot with the face?	yup yup
ya	the hardware was all there but the software rendered it more like a toy than a tool let alone a helper/companion
qelp	yeh, i feel like if the software was more close to google or amazon's pa systems then jibo would've make a much bigger splash in the market
his movement is pretty cool tho	what does lma mean?
*lmao	oh lol
thats actually a pretty good application, for a niche customer base	or like
true	coming up with ideas is harder than i thought
i have the whole folder shared with u	alright, done with my first drafts of my final apps
wpi?	and umich
nice. ru ready for editing?	yup yup
what physics work	lab due wed
free resp. counter	hefty amount of stuff lol
i didnt' k dis	didn't he tell you in class?
legged helicopter	perfect
? lol	you working out????
its leg day. i'm about to go to my appointment soon	you getting mad calves?
nah thighs are where it's at	you into thighs?
noiiice	you got an eta?
probably 7:30 to 8	lol hot dayumn
he's a 50 yr old man dude	ahh
🐱	🐱
can u give me the question?	nvm, the internet gave me a solid answer lol
uh so my mom is pissed at me and she said i can't go to ur house	🐱
what time tomorrow?	idk
and also if there's any hw that i could do i could do it for u if u guys are still working on mousetrap	we also need to make up some data logs lol
and i can come help with helicopters after e club tomorrow	ben and i ran out of time lol
there are a few in the box lol	i slipped in the shower, i used some shitty body lotion
also do u still need the lab?	no update from boston dynamics
the lab?	wowow, you have yet another addition to the justin yu fan club lol
wait wut	vara msgd in the chat that apparently johanna fanned over you
idk	me popular
really? why not	ben and i worked on mousetrap until nine-ish
i got into a fight with my mom after the doctors lol	wow this sticker thing is so stupid it's funny
and she refused to drive me to ur house	u doing alright? parent fights are never fun
so idk how that works	ur mom believes in green injection gmos???
🐱	wait u got into an argument with ur mother over vaccines...
and also why i get sick with the flu like every yr xd	wat, you don't get the flu vaccine
and so i was tryna argue with her thats important i get them	well i guess you can maybe develop a great immune system lol
and shes like "wesstern medicine is a lie beep boop chinese medicine doesn't have vaccines blah blah these doctors don't k what their doing"	wait yeh, when u get laid in ur first week of college you dun wanna get sick
ya i guess	alright so the goal is to be done with mousetrap by five ish
tanishk wants to help with build events too btw	but then i'll have to shift gear to school work or else i. ded
ya that's fine	wow you're pretty serious about working out
🐱	"wow my son is finally a man"
or u can just do hw until we arrive to help	how do you feel about the possibility that we won't have anything too presentable for helicopter
ya	mind if i join for a bit
oh ok	when you think you're going to be done?
probably 4:30	eta?
so like 5 min for me	kk
i can get us a six pack of cold ones	lmao sure
 foxy roxy missed your call.	 you missed a call from foxy roxy.
5 min lol sorry i got caught up in something	you picking up girls?
 you called foxy roxy.	https://www.amazon.com/victor-metal-pedal-mouse-trap/dp/b00c1nn4b6/ref=sr_1_6?s=lawn-garden&ie=utf8&qid=1515631734&sr=1-6&keywords=big+mousetrap
oh also is it ok if i go to your house during lunch to check that mousetrap is all set to run?	no keys
wait but how are we gonna get the mousetrap after school	mothers going to be back after school since i gotta go see the doc
can i take your hot glue gun and string to the meet	idk about the whole spool of string but we can just take a long strand of it
🐱	🐱
have u done the stretch problems	i'm going to pass them in later lol
wdym later?	shoulderin' this as a drop
welp	like passin' it in on tuesday
i just don't k that theiyre right	all of them but 36 are on the internet i think
i've only done 36 so far lol	ayyy
lol it's ok i'll send i answers	you're too good for me
lol u ok?	i've been trying to grind w/o breaks to maximize my productivity
whats keepin u so busy/	calc test, physics mc, drama line memorization, psych readings (i've been putting those on the backburner for a while now lol), college apps
lol	:o
://minerva.union.edu/labrakes/uniform%20circular%20motion_solutions.pdf#45: https://www.physics.drexel.edu/~wking/courses/phys101_w07/notes/rec5.pdf	damn boi
applications	i'm so good at that
u got me on some web assigns	if we ever work at the same company, i promise to not make the financial situation any worse
 foxy roxy missed your call.	ah shit
game board is out btw	this is quite the board this year
theres multipliers everywhere	"if ateam member is sitting in the audience reprogramming the robot wirelessly, then the team will beasked to leave the table."
hey we were standing and we weren't in the audience so	we should ask that at the workshop
defered from georgia tech wooooooohooo	holy shit what
buzz doenst want me :'(	damn, buzz is brutal
i was planning on rescinding my application but my mom didn't want me to	that's interesting that buzz said no though
ur in college boi	i submitted on jan 1st and they got back to me on jan 5th with a scholarship too
damnnn	yeh, it was way quicker than i expected
🐱	can you go to max's?
i also have a lot of shit to catch up on lol	yeh i feel
lol u k it's not gonna be an hr	i'll set an alarm for myself lol
kinda like baymax	lmao
welp what hapoened	college apps lol
ayyy	i know i shouldn't have done this
also all the parts are at your house right?	what do you mean by "all" since i think jason has the towers stuff in his house
besides the towers stuff	then i think so
that's fine	do want me to clean it lol?
lol if u can that would be good	i got'chu
lol no	in drama sometimes we have improv days in which we just do improv on stage given a scenario
lmaoo	lmaoooooo
lol but its all inside jokes	you can get everyone in on the jokes
lol	how creepy would it be if i tried to sneak into jonothan hursts lab if i visit oregon
nah i'm sure hes gotten wierdos like u before	how bad would it be if i showed up under his car
what if that's just all his employees. they just all got there by sneaking into his lab and he let them stay	lol
bc no sane person would hinge their career on legged robots amirite	he and his team really embodies the idea of "it's not where you create, it's what you create"
woops	i'm actually quite impressed by what jh does there
is the most fertile ground for robotics	yeh
ional natural resource base is the platform for industry clusters in forestry and wood products, agriculture, nursery products, and food processing. "	i personally have done no research about that place so idk if he was just talking shiz or not lol
🐱	maybe he's up there since he's creating a robo like ex machina and he needs to keep it secret
well if a robot like ex machina existed it could be among society right now and we wouldn't k it	nah, we would
🐱	i mean that's some roboticists dream, making robots that are just like humans. there's a japanese roboticist who has already made replicas of himself,
i would consider those robots more sculptures than robots	(small tangent, can we call all crappy technology "build events" from now on)
lol sure	idt they would count as sculptures though, i do agree they fall more into the art realm
its like pygmalion to the extreme	i think as we get closer to more lifelike robots this will pose to be a bigger issue
i don't right now anyone's concerned about being artificially created as a robot cuz no one is able to do that yet	wait, it's possible to fully clone a human?
but theoretically it should be the same with a sheep as with a human	would you be ok with a clone person?
like in general or a clone of me	in general
lol you guys meme some really random stuff	yeh
lol hey i only meme legged robotics	are you feeling alright?
*meetup	oh, i was worried that you felt bad from the memeage/teasing
🐱	ooh, idk about max, but i've actually never seen one
or a 10 pt scale	thinking about it more i suppose so
so maybe it's better if we tone that down a bit lol	wait, we didn't get the same amount of discussion done??
like we were suppose to	hmm, i do agree with the memeage toning down but i think we also spent a lot of time speculating how the mechanisms of the robots would work rather th
🐱	is that strat in the notes?
wdym	is the new strat stuff after i left recorded down in the docs?
it was just max and i talking after we presented	"robots:thiccbot - "
cuz it's going for thicc butters	ok, i see how severe the memeage truly was now looking at the results
i still don't think that's really a balanced strat cuz we have no idea how the tram is gonna work when we interact with it	i honestly suspect that a lot of strats are going to change once we finish building the board and see how the parts actually interact with each other
maybe after the boards built we create quick proofs of concept for each of our robots	or failure of concept amirite :')
:'(	i feel like we're underestimating the yellow crate strat a bit too much considering how the camera works and the various factors that can trick it. un
just get at a good angle and take a picture and then you'll k which regions which	do we know if the there's a position of the camera on the board that can capture a good look of the 3 zones?
well we only need to get 2 in frame	and then we also have to be warry of the colored poms, we can't take that picture if they're near us
with both robots	oh wait, we aren't just letting the crate bot just push the frisbees into where they need to go?
even if we do, the lego bot is doing the same camera work still	you know what would make this easier and or probably actually more complicated
frick i should probably talk to ppl at this meetup	yeh, that's why you're there huh haha
i thought there would be more tech than social :')	:')
theres a table full of budlight lmao	they ain't gonna be checkin' your id
does the lab take long?	nah, not really
japanese dudes r intense	what the fuk
is that ur goal?	there was already the guy making mini humanoid robots that can tightrope walk and ride bicycles as his hobby too
btw what topics are covered in chapters 1 - 5?	bruh lol
but i got bubble tea so it's ok	wasn't too informative?
i was hoping to network for mahacks	damn dude, you're quite persistent
🐱	lmaooooo
lmao yes wdym is that a lot	i could spend that kind of money in an hour
2.5 billion = 2500 atlases	which ver?
🐱	🐱
💪	💪
so that's why the other net worth aren't huge	wait, what's the point of net worth actually...
it's a standard metric u can measure ppl s wealth by	is that how rich ppl do dick measuring contests?
it's like gpa	ok, dick measuring contests
what other ppl s net worth are	what if that's what the big business life is like
🐱	wait a sec
jk	when is robotics actually going to break out in the market i wonder
rn it's just too expensive	i actually wonder what the key is
ya but that's still a long ways away bc it needs to adapt to so many situations to actually be useful	legged locomotion allows robots to adapt to any environment u know
i admit i'm not too caught up with the tech but i would say when we're 40	i would say 40 for when we get to see this stuff being more popular and actually prevalent among the middle class
are they really slaves if their not sentient	slave: "a device, or part of one, directly controlled by another."
u can call ur phone a slave by definition	in that case, i would say no
ok ya	i recall you having an interesting convo with vara on this topic lol
u don't call domestication immoral bc dogs are slaves	oh, i was referring to higher lvl sentience lol
yo boi come down to the botball room if u have time	what's going on??
wdym	i forgot to stock up :'(
for the long snow day ahead	if there is one announced first thing i'm gonna do is go buy some
unfortunately i'm far from the cold one supply :'(	:'(
oh shit was the lab due today	jeezus man lol
what should i know?	bruh
like say i just k the equations and basic concepts	then you should be ok?
oh so it took a long time?	some kids didn't finish mc
how long did u study for	maybe a couple hours total?
i haven't started	and that's what i fell asleep and woke up to lol
i'm really banking on that snowday tomorrow	judith isn't announcing until the morning
smhhhh	i think i figured out how the servo configurations work on that japanese guy's robos though
bruh	what's a good material i can use to build this i wonder
i owe u again	nah nah
<3	<3
and send me a pic of ur notes lol	bruhhhhh
well i just need chapter 3 and onwards	so like have the notes
ya	this is going to be a lot of papers
are they all online?	no, i don't think so lol
wait whats the speed formula	this:
no but like what is it used for	its the speed a car on a banked frictionless curved road can travel
lol ok thankks	i think that's the only formula you need to know that isn't on the cheat sheet
this is actually scaring me lol if this is gonna be on the test	don't worry about that one lol
did u finish the webassign?	lmaooo
i lost those somewhere lol	bruh lol
how much circular motion is there	lo siento i was doing drama
i bombed that test	d:
d:	where u at
invitational r tomorrow man	where u at rn
i need to start my physics lab now lol	did i share that with you?
thanks	anytime
we just did mission possible	lmaooo
 foxy roxy missed your call.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=34&v=vsveqrjlrto
 you called foxy roxy.	here now?
 you called foxy roxy.	damn damian be sippin'
not surprised	did you already order your cap n' gown stuff btw?
oh shit	somebody might've accidently used my student id
u should probably get that checked	i just msg'd president bacon
wdym	ppl are asking if i can help with their tech issues
i mean u can say no if u want	what the fuck is this "no" you speak of
🐱	what do you think about smart clothes
right now the only real market for smart clothes is rich professional athletes	what about a kind of clothing that isn't worn all the time like a scarf or jacket
that could work but if the smart clothing is taking biometrics i don't think u can do that easily with a jacket	it'll look like fucking magic when you just start talking to the air on a phone call without using your hands
well wearable clothing right now is pretty much all biometrics and health	who cares about that, the weight room is all you need for that
well definitely i don't think it should be woven into clothing	there has been a tech made a while back that was basically a touch screen that you put on your skin
isn't it the projector bracelet thing?	nah nah
like what is it attached to	let me find the thing real quick
is it literally just like plastic wtap	it's permanent
right now it's just led lights right	i believe so
except u can't really use it when your exercising and id imagien it's kinda uncomfortable	well maybe the consumers should stop being pussies and just suck it up
then it could jog with u	that's disturbing af
oh	did you know the google glass concept is actually still being used?
ya like in factories and stuff	i'm starting to wonder why google glass flopped so hard now
i think that's mainly it	lol
everyone's looking at it at all times	so you're saying that this market of wearable ar tech is open rn and nobody has tackled it just cuz it's hard to make shit not ugly???
or visible disruption	just put it on sunglasses and make it retractable
would u wear google glass to school every day if u had one	you're talking to the guy who still forgets he has a smartphone
it's always on ur face	if the display was retractable i think it would be socially acceptable
maybe ya	if it was a projection that could just be turned off
to be fair the display actually just blends into ur peripheral vision when ur not using it	and it just showed up on regular glasses, not that little block of glass
also ya it's off by default and shuts off after like 10 sec	but the display looks stupid
but ya it looks kinda dumb	http://www.bilisimcafe.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/google-glass.jpg
the google glasses intention is suppose to fit over regular glasses, not to be warn just alone	i wonder why they can't use the same tech that the bracelet projector ppl use
wdym	i think that's kind of cumbersome though, you don't buy a phone to just attach it to something else lol
there's no surface to project it on when it's on ur face	in this day and age most electronics are supposed to stand alone i feel like
u have to project it through a crystal	http://aiclarke.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cicret-bracelet-1.jpg
ya ik	but have it project on the surface of the glasses instead of the skin
wouldn't it just go through	idk enough optics lol
so it looks like a screen	why can't the prism be more flat and not a box then?
well bc look at the angle it has to be at for redirection	what if the projector just projects straight into your goddamn retina
well actually thats just virtual reality glasses	technology i think is just a bit too bulky rn to be fashionably accepted
ya i agree	unless somebody who has influence over all the zombies of pop culture decided to wear stuff, maybe like kim carcrash
lmao	oh man, i kind of wish i had one of those projection bracelets now just to test it out
wearable tech def as well actually	reallyyy
hmmm	what about the whole iot fad
that u can control it with	is it really that desirable or useful
i can see the use for homes	doesn't seem really groundbreaking and more of an add on
i'm just talking about things that i think will happen	and then robots will become cheap and useful right?
mhm	i wonder if there's another way to consume and communicate information
hmm u mean completely new	but a method that is better than computing or just as good
well if u talk about physics  all fast communication has all been based on electricity or electromagnetism from basically the telegram onward	wut about light
so do u mean something com0letely different?	yup yup
hmm	get this
🐱	i think electromag has got the cake pretty well rn though, objects/mediums that rely on things with mass are cumbersome and bulky
i wonder what the next smartphone will be. it has to be something that we don't actually think we need until it exists	like fucking legged robotics
maybe	we don't think we need it until it exists
ya same	it wasn't like the computer was a long sought after achievement/advancement like flight
it's amazing that he did it himself tho and not a big company	but were those ppl doing it in their bedroom for fun lol
ya well that's why i feel there couldve been hundreds of steve jobs and only 1 woz	statistically speaking there's probably someone who had a similar revolutionary creation like woz but since there was no jobs figure it went unnoticed
ya	oh man, i wonder if musky and woz could've been a powa team
lmk if u need editing	i'm over on each essay by 66 words
well that's not too bad	do you have any extra springs btw
no	darn
wait who did u have write urs?	ms. hession
is everything ok now?	idk, they haven't got back to me yet
i didn't sign up to take real classes when i signed up for oc what is this	lol
lol u made a prototype leg?	it's literally 5 pieces of cardboard and a makeshift spring lol
hopefully just for this week tho. i just have a shit ton of stuff to catch up on after midterms + college apps	i'm going to check in on you by next week to make sure you're not scheduling shit until 2 am again
and adult life in general	that's how ppl die bruh
so it evens out :d	conscious while being in a default low battery mode
nah caffeine pillllsss	drugs are not the answer!
welp	welp
that's a weird ass fetish roy ngl	thx man
u might have to teach him some stuff	kk
uss build events and make concrete plans for building. u probably won't be able to actually build anything during winblock so it shouldn't take u long	ngl
wait why?	afterwards i just sat in the basement wondering for a good couple of hours what i was doing lol
and r u fine now	wondering why i'm not having fun/remotely having fun building shiz for sci oly anymore lol
is it just the time spent on building sci oly?	idk, perhaps
would u want to do study events for sci oly?	gud one mah boi
but it's just there aren't that many ppl who can build stuff for sci oly	nah don't worry about it, we got more time now
maybe u could find a system to spread out the work more for builds	sorry about this man ^^" i know it wasn't ideal
nah i mean it's hard in of itself	welp time to learn cad
what r u working on now?	i need to remodel this mechanism
*spoons	thx man, i was going for a fork doe
it feeds u by walking up to ur mouth	fuking geniusssss
like why would u need machine learning on the robot?	to let it learn how to walk
idk if it's really a good way to train the robot	really?
similarly a legged robot trained purely with ai probably couldn't withstand wind	damn you wrote a mini essay on dis lol
well i had econ so	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sb5ce0on3ty
i can read it during lunch or after i get home around 7	friday night would be nice
not a problem	dang, coming home at 7??
oh ya a hot date with my grandparents	oh ic ic
and ya everythings fine	this is the story
also damn. wait was this walking to the school in the morning?	wait i don't think all legged animals exhibit it lol, a shit ton of four legged mammals have hooves
awwwwww	it's not cute!
oh the hovercraft came in	🐱
but it had to be done	what if the kit just doesn't work lol
🐱	are ya serious
welp	maybe it was telling me to get back to work lol
lol why is david mad at me now....	?
it's probably not a big thing (hopefully) it was just bizarre	ppl get petty these days over the smallest things
ya it's strange how ppl focus on these really small things	it's cuz everything you do now is a passive aggressive move lol
why me	idk
🐱	maybe it's personal idk man lol
welp	you know how regular hobby servos have no feedback?
how would u read the analog signal from the potentiometer	the pot has three tabs
lol don't burn anything	i can't wait for my theory to be wrong and then ruin my shit
🐱	this is all for the cause of legged robotics
wdym	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w29avx3dzje
somehow second semester seems busier than jr yr	well
i'm tryna learn more ml, study chinese, learn more linguistics, looking for a 4th language to learn, and i have a list of books i want to get through)	"i feel like i have too much on my plate"
i might drop mgh thing but i feel bad	yeh i felt bad too, until i dropped it lol
lol	the number one thing you don't want to do with those self study goals is to make them into a chore
se sudden bouts of anxiety that last about an hr where i just freeze and am unable to do anything bc im feeling overwhelmed. they come and go randomly	if you want to do them then carve out a good time to just sit down and enjoy them instead of like random "i should do this" it should be more like "i 
i've been trying but idk where to carve out 😞	how about we hit the gym b block tomorrow
i got a pile of emails to respond to	bruhhhhhhh
i don't have any other time to do it	realistically there really is only a certain amount of time in the day
also i would still need to carve out some more time if we're gonna do a senior project	it might seem kinda harsh but with ur current schedule it's probably better to prioritize the things with actual deadline and hold things that don't u
stupid brains	didn't we talk about how that's an unhealthy mindset lol
its been a year :/	how about you slow down tonight and list what things you actually want to do, emphasis on want
i readily drop the things i'm not interested in like rwdc. but i'm just bad at having a focused set of interests	that's not necessarily a bad thing
:/	max and i have been building chad steadily we should have a prototype in a couple weeks
nah my tema does do other tasks. my job is to do sponsorship relations and stuff so i'm handling emailis. theres justa crap ton of them	bruhhhhhhhhhh
after a mun officer meeting and before the sci oly officer meeting	i really do think you should sit down and leave some stuff you can do later for actually later, like learning a fourth language
but i'm still young and memorization capabilities deteriorate swiftly	bruh you got like 5 years
ya but i'm only getting busier by the day	that's cuz you're making yourself busier by the day lol
and it seems like itneresting stuff but we haven't really done it yet	it sounds like you're making it sound sweeter than it is because you're afraid of what possibilities you might lose if you say no
it stresses me out lol	i think you might want to be a bit more cynical like cheng then when thinking about this stuff
well with building a physical thing its different bc u have a set end goal already	but i feel like a fair amount does, esp pertaining to your making a book interest and ml
what i'm talking about are the things you didn't k u liked or u didnt' expect to be interesting but end up shifting ur entire interest	like you wanting to make books?
mahacks came out of me walking into a conversation b/w some beaverworks ppl on ar andom day at beaverworks	dude that's literally just chance lol
and i wouldn't be doing accion if i wasn't spending a lot of time going to networking events that in every other sense was a waste of time	ok ready for a wise old saying time that imma paraphrase
besides me just fucking around	wouldn't you need to learn ml first
ya well i k enough to do the mgh thing	and what is this real stuff you're talking about
like using eeg data to analyze and help diagnose alzheimers	how much you wanna bet you can find datasets online?
its medical dat from very expensive equipment	damn, you really thought this through huh lol
but the value is mainly in that there will be someone who is an expert in the field guiding the process	is that what you hoped with for mit primes?
kinda ya	i think you're doubting your own abilities there lol
idk what the axes even are	a fellow intern from ucla was working on eeg signals and he just read online and stuff to figure out how to map it and stuff
tru	(i feel like this is the third time we've had this convo lol)
we'll probably continue to have these convos throughout and after college lol	that's fine by me haha
🐱	:'(
i'm gonna take a nap to get out of this funk	yeh, sleeping always flushes away bad mojo feels
i think its just cuz all 3 major clubs mun, sci oly and botbal are all ramping up at the same time	well for sci oly you got a pretty reliable team of juniors to catch you
thankss	and don't worry about reading my college essays since you're so busy lol, i can ask someone else
lol does that actually happen?	i used to get sick from watching any virtual 3d motion lol
i get sick from vr but usually if it's a flat screen it's fine	that's quite the skill you got there
we're on a big pickle right now lol	what kinda pickle? i thought you weren't doing hmun
anizing problems. we had to wait for iman to confirm she was going to naimun and then the hotel said our rooming expired so we have to get a new order	ahh
so we're trying to get the order in again	oh....
thanks	did ya bring the hovercraft kit?
yup	what class u got rn?
latin	wait who's going to the hmun dance tonight
some of the hmun ppl probably	🐱
and make sure whenever u use "passsionate" to describe urself you have a bunch of other concrete examples	oh
ya that's fine	as i review these last two apps the more i doubt myself lol
oh shit i forgot to read urs	🐱
when r u planning on submitting again	tonight lol
shit	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms7noumgrto
oh nice	wanna try and steal it with me?
🐱	man, that's like 4 universities that bought a cassie
how much does each cost	agility robotics wouldn't disclose specific numbers, saying only that their goal is to end up with sub-$100k robots
more like a private jet	i bet agility robotics have mad revenue man 💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸
🐱	ouch
isnt that just a transformer	apparently the show is called macross
lol	freaking amazing
btw can u make the botball meeting today at 8?	wat
lmao u gotta check the discord man	mah apps
the deadlines feb 1st right?	gud one
after the meeting we can do an editing sess	you're too good for me
so is that a yes for the meeting?	yeh
hmm interesting	as an entrepreneur (who apparently likes to write books), what do you think about their current situation?
well they're probably not gonna stay local especially since it looks like this product is starting to attract customera	what do you mean "looks like" >:((( they sold 4 units
their manufacturing will probably have to expand beyond scott from corvallis tho lol	but scott sounds like a fucking badass
really? well idk anything about siracha lol but	cassie can be the siracha sauce of robots @_@
economics of scale	i'll make the robots for free
plus i might be wrong but oregon doesn't seem like it will attract a lot of ppl for further r&d	i'm sure if they can attract ppl like me they can attract other robo idiots
ng that jeremy was excited about starting the robot and drew up a design lol. and i don't think he's gonna be actively trying to take over or anything	yeh...
*negative impact, not negative benefit	i see what you're talking about and i do agree
ya...	also are you feeling ok
well i was titled when it started becoming memey	that whole situation got more and more ironic as we argued over a little thing lol
like at the beginning it was a suggestion by max and i disagreed and we had a discussion	i didn't think it got memey, rather it just got more confusing as the talking went on
ere complete memes and then neither u or david gave a reason for why u agreed to it and jennifer was arguing against it but accidentally argued for it	you also didn't take a cold one bottle home with ya my boi!!
thanks tho	i thought the analogies max were trying to go for were fairly legitimate until we all started laughing at the idea of the comparison
i still don't understand why it would help anything tho	the reason why i agreed was that besides just some more work for us it isn't much of a thing for us to do
but it just makes it harder to understand the document	ppl always interpret things with a bias right? it's just default that we have a schema on how we interpret the world
the list idea is to list everyone's name in no particular order and next to each name u have "balanced, create"	and a lot of ppl are insecure about themselves and how other ppl view them. especially highschoolers
like over and over again	so even the way you present data will be interpreted differently by different ppl
*if	hold on itttsss hard to type on this piece of glassss
lol sorry	this would be easier if the phone had hands
ya ik but even as trivial as the problem that the list is suppose to solve is, the list still wouldn't solve it	in the end, yes you're right they will probably still think that
but it says the group names  right next to their names....	but the point is that that feeling of wtf why am i not here is mitigated and they won't care as much
this just makes the document less clear and it will take them longer to actually find out who the other members of their group are	cuz of the order they take in the data, they look for group first and be petty second
if they have problems with which group they're in they will ahve those problems regardless	cuz apparently some juniors are sensitive, which now that i think about it i've never actually seen for myself lol save for a few times i got stuck in
they're not gonna stop having those problesm if the groups are put in farther down the document cersus if they're actually just stated at the top	i think the point wasn't that they wouldn't have the problem, they still would regardless. making the doc a bit convoluted is to mitigate that feeling
lso this has nothing to do with if u stab a knife quickly versus if u slowly sink a knife into someone. idk why max made that analogy except for memes	oh that actually might've been a meme lol
right but the problems will still be there regardless of the organization right	yes the problems will still be there
it won't actually solve it bc they will just scroll down tot he cell descriptions and get that visceral reaction then instead of at the top of the doc	are they so rattled that they would do something about it or be fairly rattled and not do anything
practice lol	it's not stopping the problem i think, it's trying to lower the severity of the feeling they get
and then adding a list	of course none of us know if this will actually work since psychologists still don't have a great way to measure emotion lmao
the scary thing is he seemed like a pretty nice guy	geezus
he was so nice	holy shit
i feel unclean	lol i doubt he would use the money from his sex ring to fund an academia program
tru	yeh idk
ya....	it feels like a plot twist of a movie
ya ikr im still kinda mind blown	except it's real lol
i painted yellow beavers onto a race track with that man :'(	lol
i don't think its a missing persons case, but its coercing women to work as "escorts"	wait is that a prostitute then?2
i think sex-trafficking is basically just euphamism for prostitution	ooh
and sex-trafficking is one part	i guess you can now say that you were face to face with a human trafficker and lived to tell the tale
iit seems stupid	why did jeremy delete his own stuff?
ut" referring to when jen got triggerd that jeremy was working on botball, and max and jen are meming about how shes gonna delete all of jeremy's work	yeh that was pretty harsh
why does jeremy get trashed on when he doesn't do work and trashed on more when he does work	i think max is just a hardcore memer of an intense next level scale but i don't think he means harm
ya i agree max is def a well intentioned guy i just feel sometimes he lets memes get the better of his judgement	for a guy who'd rather live in the woods of oregon and build robots i like to take notice on how ppl interact with each other
when they probably don't realize it or intend it that way	well the truth is just that people act differently around different people
ya .... :/	*probably just cuz
uh its stupid	i actually wonder what's the social reason for being mean
its stupid	that's actually a good point
s we're meming eachother to eachother's faces. but for example above, jen and max are meming jeremy but jeremy has no consent or any part of the convo	wait those two convos were separate? idk how discord works still lol
smh. i'm making this a bigger deal than it is but i feel like it happens to jeremy unjustifiably much	it's normal for you to be mad about mistreatment lol
how douchey they're acting. i k memes come from somewhere, but when it gets out of hand, ppl just start defining someone by the meme they have of them	we're using the meme so much in serious convos it's starting to feel like a more revered word now
you've become quite the psychologist	lol thanks man
i'm not gonna tell jen lol but if u want to u can	lol i was about to say the same thing
🐱	ppl are hard man
ya....	welp i better catch some zs cuz i don't i'm in a good condition to cad or read over essays anymore lol
i can read it over now and leave comments	nah don't worry about it
wdym	michigan robotics is what they call their robotics division rn
use in what context	my first sentence:
ya u can just call if michigan rkbtosjcs	thanks man
aren't those tiny	wait i thought we already had magnets
the one we used at mit was borrowed from angus	lol
im sure someone can just bring a strong magnet from home	what if my faulty legs are a sign for me to further pursue legged locomotion
you get the build replacement legs achievement bur your humanity score goes down to 50%	lmao
lol	btw has there ever been a robotics startup?
i mean ya theres been a lot	the only robo companies that i can think of that go for big complicated robos (and only robos, so no cars like toyota and honda) are irobot and bd and
i think agility robotics is a startup	but dji does drones and bd never sold a robot :'(
irobot started as a startup	i need more hope in agility robotics
the challenge is just huge startup cost sfor robot companies bc fricking hardware	i think their workforce are some grad kids and one undergrad from osu rn lol
🐱	🐱
lol	pshh
what would we do without those dinos	it seems that andy abate, the mech head of cassie is selling models of the robot
thats actually pretty cool	25-26 bucks... holy shit
for useful things	let's be honest here
investment into a roth ira account?	what the fuck is that
i dont think agility robotics is off the grid	who knows
in the war	the one where i got to make stupidly cool giant robot mechs
and then i invaded and took over alaska right after	holy crap
u probably could get the same information from just watching videos closely	but i watched all the videos already
lmao	i'mma buy one
6 gallooooooooonss	don't tempt me with your sweet words
and 3d print it urself	wouldn't that be a bit of a waste of time? since in the end i wouldn't be cading something that actually moves
maybe they can buy their employees donuts with ur money	which would motivate them to not give up on this venture
or on wednesday	yeh sure
a q&a soon, ask questions here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc3ouizkrnc now it gets faster every cycle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2qcd_t...	holy shot that fits so well
yea sure	lol thx man
it's fine	gramps computer broke
lmaoo	uh oh
why	cuz he only speaks chinese
or do u think it's too late	you can take a read over if you want
hmm i don't want to give u any last minute doubts. i'll just check for grammar and stuff	i technically have 3 days
oh ok	if something is offsounding i would rather you say it sucks than have the ao say it sucks lol
should be done in like 5 min	kkkkkkkkk
that i would try to edit	can i use laboratory
just some wording issues	<3
ya i think so. it is honest to urself so that's good	"i love business so much, i want to make a big ass company and make huge dosh"
oh i didn't read ur wpi one yet	oh lol
wait can u link me up lol\	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wyewchc0ppx7vahfmsgihlawv2y80krbwdjqaa4n5ng/edit?usp=sharing
listening to it is pretty uplifting	but it's a song for and about people who are in happy relationships
tru :'( let me dream	lol, it'll be alright
ill tell u a story after i finsh reading wpi	exciting
ok done	thank you so much
than it would be fine	"sex toys"
yeee	huh, i'm actually having a hard time thinking of what robots could be besides helpers and companions lol
ya that sounds good	aight
is still calling me	lol
but i asume thats just what college is	is it cuz of the academic rigor over there?
oh shit speaking of academic rigor when is the web assign due	when i was a slave on reddit i read a lot of stories of ppl being stressed out at uc hicago, but always on their sophomore year they hit their stride
wait really? is that a thing at uchicago	i'm just going to do it tomorrow
nice	if that helps you can tell her that
wouldn't u call home in college	do you think i call home rn lol
lol	i'm still curious about that story you wanted to tell?
oh lol woops	did you forget the story lol?
i have an english quiz	lkkkkk
both are blacj	let me check
i have to find a good time to sneak out	wait wut
was i suppose to get a pass	you can just ask if you can get a pass lol
well i have one of the more anal retentive teachers	and then run back to show your teacher it
sorry i didn't realize i had so much english shit to read	lolllll
oh sicc	but we also have the problem that mr mack is missing some of his chargers
but everything is going crazy rn	it's fine lol
memes everywhere	wat
their former territory was now called "deserted boii". however, the boii had not been exterminated	that's fuking amazing
why?	max and i are probs going to be running through a lot of ideas
welp	and if you had some i don't want you to be out of the loop
uh i can call in	kkkkkk
but i will be on a bus so i will probably just listen and not talk until i get home	what lunch you got?
2nd	damn i got 3rd
i left mgh	:o
that can be my research thing	🐱
this could be rubber bands in the back (think sci oly robot arm lols)	i have bad memories of that
ye but really quick	we have been prototyping so much and so fast
are u guys still there	max and i cleaned up and left around 3:30
oh dang	turns out my middle name has a hyphen in it
what's ur middle name	jk jk
so ur chinese name is hao chuan xing?	wouldn't it be
oh ya other way around	or as i usually go by:roy
🐱	oh yeh, i almost forgot
ya	niceeee
it's fineeeee	can't tell if you lyin' or not
i am still scheduling things till 2	🐱
🐱	bruh
there's nothing to worry about	i'm going to give you links to the webassign problems lol
thanks tho <3	dayumn boii
i didn't save any of the links i used but they were all on first page of google search and i only used it for 2 questions	ic ic
thankss	alright finally submitted all mah apps
ur free	free after i write a midyear update lol
i have to do that too	really?? :o
not sure about weedtown	when i checked weedtown didn't have one
🐱	uh idk if that's something the pussy meme is for
maybe that's more appropriate	geezus
but it does feel shitty	do you know why/where did you find this info
when i disappeared for a while it was jen and i outside talking	oh....
🐱	oh man
*eachother	aw
mun we don't really talk / she's not really there a lot	wut bout mun and venture cafe n stuff
she doesn't do that anymore	i guess in an ironic way if she's still mad at you then she kinda reinforced your comment
but i guess it is true that through the whole affair i've lost some respect for her as well	hmm i'm not the best with this kind of stuff but
i guess i don't have college apps to distract me anymore	i would offer to talk to her for you but i don't think i know her well enough lol
ya, that's ok	just to clear things up though you're not sad about her hating you despite your old crush right. more sad about losing a close friend?
i'm finding this whole thing and my schedule stress are mixing quite well to make a big anxiety cocktail lol	geezus
or did it happen while u guys were still classmates	it could/probably is also she's stressed with things like college and her own commitments
honestly i kinda don't k how to approach / talk to her anymore. i feel like everything i say has the potential to offend her	i think you should just act like you guys used to be like before harvard apocalypse
i'll just try	she actively avoids you? dang
ya like in the hall i see her walking eith friends and she just moves to the opposite side so her friends are blocking between	oh man i'm sorry
but idk who she telld	ahh
the official boring company flamethrower “starts shipping in spring.”	yeh time is interesting
ya. i have to see petty first	sounds gucci
lmao thanks for the pic	no problemo
🐱	drugs r cheaper than these services
ya	thx lol
how far did you guys design it?	the concepts are down but the drafting isn't there w/o measurements
the pulleys seem really weak	virgin pulleys?
aren't they suppose to lift like kilos	yeh...
they're just little plastic discs	and about that networking thing... got any contacts who have metal 3d printers?
but she hasn't been responding to me. i need to get her on baord for mahacks, then i can inquire about 3d printing	if you send an explosive she'll be sure to respond
that's not proper networking etiquette	*an explosively happy letter
lmao	there's etiquette??
sounds like ahookup	so is agility and bd :,( but i'm not done with college yet
u should just apply	i also don't have the funds to start my own lab
then take it and run	lmaooooo
so thats a good sign	congrats!
nah apparently she was just kinda pissed on the day but later she told vara that she and i are all back to normal	that's a similar msg lol
which confuses me a bit	maybe you can ask her
to a few months	a few months is kinda long bruh
well we were talking normally at mun yesterday	that's good!
ok	i lied
wait u mean on that flat i mean *slight incline* on the way to school	nah this time it was on the icy sidewalks
i need to k if i'm really that dumb	i fell asleep after you guys left
also i might have left a red notebook and a caesar book	if you give me ur pass i can dualboot rn
wait can u also look for notebook and caesar book	how do you manage to do this
p o w e r m o v e	i'm going to break ur computer
wait so did u find the stuff	ye
i'll just pick it up at bois night	ur pencil is even here
this was at the top of my feed lol	that's bullshit and you and i know it lol
lol	i feel like smart ppl like woz don't forget about one of the most expensive and modern vital machine that they own lol
 you called foxy roxy.	🐱
 you called foxy roxy.	🐱
elina?	yeh man
damn	i'm throughly impressed
 hbo's last week tonight with john oliver. all rights belong to hbo. check out the official channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/lastweektonight	i think they need to start screening who says they are a republican and are running for an office lol
nope	oh hey the patriots lost the baseball game
ya...	shame, tom brady was such a good goalie too
🐱	looks like angry fans are going to burn boston to the ground now
and made a whole bunch if mistakes in the last quarter	what are you talking about lol
ya	if ya haven't done the stretch problems yet:
oh damn thanks	no problemo
i didn't make any changes lol	it's alright i don't think they expect us to have a new ver already
ya	ya ready?
haha genes you little fucker you	bruh
then the tiredness kicked in	ah...
lol	aw fuck
who is it	keziah
hopefully its not some 80 yr old man who asks for a ride home	keziah robinson, class of 2000
nice	holy shit she's an actress
but what is a) asking for?	i'm turning that in tomorrow lol
has someone started that?	no idea
nice	so what da ya think about the intel glasses?
actually really cool	they fucking took our idea
and i agree that the glasses are more of a stepping point to more wearable in the future	the head movement controls are pretty cool
so that's good	but not everyone likes to wear glasses so i wonder if there's an even possibly less instructive wearable
well u have to wear the wearable whatever it is. the most miniature could be contacts but that would take some serious minitiarizatiob	smart tattoos
lol	i wonder if ppl would be ok with small humanoid robo assistants
who's venture was to surgically implant headphones into your ear bc "bluetooth headphones fall out easily"	that's insane lol
the man behind the ionic ear set the bar pretty high in the show's first episode.	lmao
he's a telcommuncations engineer	fuck
wow	wouldn't it be better to just make custom earpieces than to surgically implant one if all you want is for them to not fall out...
🐱	not true!
lol	wut
ya...	i can't believe the entrepreneurship world has become inflated
i would actually give it a watch	is it good for "what not to do"
lol well it's more like a really clueless engineer tryna do entrepreneurship	ouchhh
if only woz's brain could be paired with job's ambition, wozjob would be unstoppable	truuu
by himself	that makes him sounds like a wozjob - the soft kindness of woz lol
well idk about soft kindness but definitely he's down to earth and actually has technical skills unlike jobs	i like how out of all these ppl the person with the most seemingly stable personal/love life is zuckerfucker
well does woz have a wife	woz has had like four wives lol
and he's the same generation as jobs and woz	wait really?
in pretty sure within the same decade	is jeff bezos the same gen as musky? lol
both of them rode the .com wave and became prominent in the early 2000s	man i can't want for the robotics wave to be a thing
🐱	i guess robotics is going to be stuck deep in r&d for a while
like internet businesses which are super easy to set up	oh c'mon there's like maybe almost 50 solely robotics focused companies/startups
but i think robotics is just too technical	tru
maybe somehow of the process of building and designing new robots is simplified	there is currently a ros hardware movement
wdym	oh wait
🐱	are ya home rn?
nope i'm at boston children's hospital	oh wait you can't drive either lol
for an entrepreneurial event	you networking?
launch was successful!	ayy
lol i spent the afternoon touching some fake dead bodies	wat
well i was touring the simlab at boston children's hospital	they have a lab dedicated to simulations???
mainly for training doctors and surgeons	finished
it's string powered?	just the knee joint is
what's gonna be pulling the string?	the top servo
oh ic	i think i should probs do hw now but...
it looks like a good atart	that's what we said about chad lol
instagram.com/50_nerdsofgrey	lmao
#entrepreneurship	here's my joke on legged robots
🐱	alright
kinda	i just finished myself
oh ye	is mun today?
no mun is tomorrow	holy shit my monitor magically started working with the ubuntu side
and ya	when does b block end then d:
8:23	thx thx
lol wut	oh yeh
how can i use the best text editor nano	lol
the creation of a true wozjobs	lmao
but honestly what musk has accomplished is so amazing	but he never made a robot
but the entrepreneur gets credit for bringing all these ppl together and giving them all a vision to work towards	tru tru
bc my phone is dumb	i just realized colleges won't even know what a slip model is
r u writing ur feb update?	yeh for schoolios
damnnn	i love how they still keep the meme strong
wait why are you emailing updates? isn't there an online thing for it	i called each college
oh i just got contacted for stanford intreview	nice!!!
tim zajic	aw man
thats so funny	can we swap lol
whos ur person?	this is her sum in linkedin: " business strategist and investor with 15+ years of experience working with ceos, founders & executive leadership across
i dont think we can switch lol	well on the brightside hopefully our ppl don't know too much about the opposite fields
i think its just too early of a stage as it is rn for most ppl to get what ur trying to accomplish	i now know why hurst kept the monopod research/breakthroughs on the down-low until he finished the whole robot and made it bipedal
i'm sure the surgical earphones also made that sharktank guy jizz in his pants	i suppose the skill would be to know when a product is presentable and useful
whereas jobs insisted that the netire thing be made with ui/ux designed so anyone could use it	tru
ya why?	just wondering if ya wanna go to some testing on chad w/ me
and also i need to finish writing my sci oly test for the tryouts this friday	kkkkkkkk
in the middle of states prep season for sci oly	nah it's alright man
thanks	no problemo
btw do u have open ends tomorrow?	e block i do
oh wait can u check if u have the box and the magnets in ur basement	what does it look like?
cuz we can use any box really	do ya remember what the magnets look like? size n' stuff
magnet sized	lol
i think one of them is like a grey shiny cilinder thing	yeh, couldn't find it
do you have any magnets?	all i got are fridge magnets lol
can you look for the box again?	i can during e block
why?	cuz idk what it looks like lol
hmm could i go to ur house during lunch?	uhhhh
i have 2nd	i have third lunch
so not ideal	welp shit
so i'll be there in third lunch	lol bruh
i'm on the balcony of the caf	where u at
proabbly 11th place	lol it's alright
gotta come cuz i have english quuz	🐱
🐱	now that's worth
lol	how's mun so far?
why	cuz we kept abusing their generosity lol
uc decisions came out	nah they are rolling
🐱	it's feb bruh lol
ya that's why it's unexpected	late march is when they will finish al of them
no one else here got an email	i thought you took back ucb?
no i completely forgot about that bc of how busy	🐱
the past few weeks have been	bruhhh lol
🐱	i guess they really wanted you
lol theybdont need another asian cs nerd	or maybe ucb girl made sure you got in
lmaio	how's mun so far
here's what your missing	dude i'm in there rn lol
wait does it work?	lmao no of course not
u missed the delegate dance	it's been standing for almost 5 minutes now
btw sorry we weren't there to work on chad	nah it's fine
it's ok you must accept the unviabilitu	i can't believe it has a repeatable point of balance on my first try
? how would it be unrepeatable	meaning that when i tense up the springs and plop it down carefully it can balance
oh niceee	i was afraid that it would end up like atrias since i actually have no actual ankle control
there's your wholesome meme of the day	lol thx
how about "unviable"	🐱
i barely k her ok	i feel like i'll hear that line a lot in the future
hey you wanna take a break from working on unviable and play online smash	i was about to go to sleep lol
we had to do curfew for mun	plus you would lose anyway
and now i don't want to sleep but im bored	🐱
weeakkkkkkk]	you could help me write some code for jocelyne and research proper i2c chips to control the servos
🐱	doesn't mun require you to get sleep and be aware lol
nah its all done, tomororw is the last day and we finished evyerhing already	who are ya rooming with
max and vara	ahhh
🐱	alright that does it
can u create the room?	yeh sure
wait so u can't access onlin at all?	nah i changed it when i got locked out last time lol
lol welp	one sec lol
lol	aw shit i think it targets your whole system?
how does smash have better security than gmail	🐱
welp	alright
ok good night	have fun with jocelyne
dude its so amazing	that was so good
shit i also didnt see ur messages before	how did wut go?
the meeting wtih mahoney	i took notes and shared it
we just worked together on the same directives	what does she look like ya stud
lol	you feeling better?
just been super busy	you in school today?
yup	you wanna chad with me during d block?
so yea most likely	nioce
thanks man	btw can you open the back foot lol
do u still need it	nope
wait my eye is bleeding	wat
gotta do what u gotta do	were you guys able to sneak out of that assembly?
what happened?	it was pretty awkward and cringy overall lol
the most important detail	lmaooo
not on kipr's	ayyyy
get ready for a surprise during e block	🐱
lmaoooo	send me some dank updates/vids of mun
but do u k like what specifically about him has been rubbing u the wrong way?	i think the way he talks to people perhaps
but also he can afford to go to botball like every day bc he's already in his ed college so	yeh i was able to come to my own satisfying conclusion that i think settled my thoughts
is there anything in particular that triggered it?	nah not really lol
unlike vara	🐱
kinda sad it took such a hit	this is your chance to mend it
like i kinda wanna hang out with her	that makes you sound like a creep
:/	that doesn't mean you can't make her comfortable
that was ethan august	lol
lol	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgyjnqojvxe
your too good	why did you spam the swobo chat lol
but my internet lags a lot on this wifi	lmaooo
wait roy did you actually create an insta	it's a meme
lol did you make iy	yeh
ya i recommended it to her	wait is she going to mahacks?
🐱	i think i cut my hair way too short
will i finally see what your forehead looks like	yeh
*using	the second option is splitting the input and output to be done by two separate mc
ah ok	this is becoming exponentially more complex than i anticipated
jeezus	you should sleep early mi amigo
ian dinner in the afternoon, botball and mahacks meeting in boston on thursday and entrepreneurship club friday morning + mahacks final prep on friday	ahh icic
🐱	oh wait that works out since i'm gone thursday
nice nice	you can take a break wednesday from botball
u sure	damn dude you should take sunday off or something
but i feel bad cuz i haven't been there that much	yeh don't worry about, i gotchu
nah it's fine i'll come on wednesday	da bois got ur back
i might nap in the middle but i'll b there	lol nap at home then napping in such a chaotic environment is the equivalent as napping outside
🐱	i'm touring massrobotics
ah ok	and then robbing them blind
nah i have an mahacks meeting at 9	boi
which will probably go like 1-2 hrs	just don't burn out this week
ok	if you're eye is still broken take it off
*weeks	it's a pretty bad sign doe
*fatigue	yeh that's another reason to take wednesday off lol
look how viable this robot is. it just blew someones brains out	that's not what i want robots to do
in the episode, the killer robots are called "dogs"	why they gotta get inspiration like dat
closer to real life	the writer for ieee automation is actually sad/annoyed everyone on bd's videos are always like "oh no! killer robots!"
lol	should i spend 20 bucks on a specialized servo controller?
mmmm how much more precise than what you lareday have?	yup
*how much more precise	oh idk
oh lol	got it
that pretty hacky	yeh....
respond to jason	alright i can come and give him the glue and exactos
whats the plan for mision possible	build
but like what sht eschedule?	idk anytime i'm awake and in the basement lol
i mean theres not much f or you to do here tbj	i could just do break hw there
;)	which part of the lib?
lets make it happen ;)	you don't have servos lol
oh ill provide plenty of thrust ;)	it would need to be torque not thrust
;)	the actuators would also need to be low mass so that the inertia of each joint especially those on the legs will be low
when you compile a lot of mass in a short height	the inertia must be low so that the momentum of the leg will be easier to control
;)	due to the fact that flat feet designs rely on the actuator being in the joints they are slow
hey, even if those bars need to be sliding at parallel angles	interesting that you bring that up because the slip mass model (spring loaded inverted pendulum) with a depression dampening effect has become a more 
meeting room	where's that
where r u now ill come down	https://youtu.be/afua50h9uek
that's insane	ikr
ya i'll be there soon	eta?
probably like 20 min	kkkkk max and i have some updates for ya and fully commentated and cleaned up cofe
get that filthy commented code out of thete	where u at
walking	tell us if you jason's dead body
lol wut	jason said he was walking three hours ago and he's still missing
oh shit	are you still at davids?
nooe	lol thx man
npnp	that was a pretty fun party
ye haven't had one in a while	did not expect to enjoy socialization with a lot of ppl so much
🐱	🐱
after mahacks i will be so much more free to hang out with ppl and stuff	what about winmun
eh that's not nearly as much work	ahh ic ic
but after that	bruh
but after that	bruhh
shit	🐱
i never really did that	wait really
it was mainly cuz my latin teacher asked really nicely and not man y other ppl go	i think i'm actually out for rwdc around the time of regionals so it's pretty clutch that our schedules covers for whenever we're absent lol
oh it's the week before right	yup yup
it's kinda sad this will be our last botball season	hmm i haven't felt nostalgic or melancholic just yet about the whole our last year of high school
mun is basically ovee	ahhh
but actual conferences are ovee	ah yeh, everything slowing down then
there's a river in b/w	dat's dumb
did u go to mit sloan	i want free monitors
any starbucks	but there's ppl there
yo roy when are you done with ur tour?	just finishing up
do you want a ride home?	sure but i was planning to hang around the area for a while and do some work
if u want just lmk	i'm taking a dump in the stats building rn
uh	how's mahacks
i'm not nearly as stressed about it as last mahacks	is it near the stata building? i need a place to crash ;)
lol no it's over by north station	where da fuk is north station
i was gonna tell him to stop but he also looked kinda homeless	i think he was your future self
ok im not gonna be creepin around high school hackathons	that's pretty hilarious
i'll be mooching off of soup kitchens like a respectable human	yeh ok, you'll be creeping around technovation?????
lol	i'll just be continuing taking dumps around kendall square and sloan if ya wanna drop by
that we always go to	isn't that kinda far lol
lmao	is this from mun?
i don't k any of these ppl	or did you get so black out drunk you forgot you went to that party lol
i kinda wanna troll and play along	that might be kinda creepy lol
lol	i made a mistake sitting here
shit i just missed my train	wut
ye	ahhh
it's ok two of my team members are going	this could be a good opportunity to take it slow and chill for the rest of the day
lol nahhhhh	or maybe you could use one of those telepresence robots
i might just ask them to vid call me in	boi
our venue might be too small	how?
so our venue would fit 80 very well but idk about 111	bruh
shiiiiiit	that's 138.75% your carrying capacity
im kinda hoping some ppl won't come	idk if you should bank on that lol
ye.....	could you maybe cut ppl?
i dont think so	well is the venue going to be mad that you're stuffing so many ppl in?
i think they'll be fine	so then the problem is just handling/cramming in that many ppl?
ya	welp
i dont think that will sell	you could have elimination rounds
and ppl might get pised abotu that	well they should suck it up like men then
damn	idk about you but all these mit kids are nerdy af looking
maybe not in the cs building lol	yeh that makes a lot of sense
lol	there's a lot of young lookin' ppl here
i'm really nervous now that i think our venue is too small	i was sitting next to the daycare thing but this girl came out of a lecture hall with a backpack and everything lol
rn they're still counting chairs and making a catalogue of the different rooms	ahh ic ic and you're vid calling i'm assuming?
over messenger	that situation sounds a lot more conducive to anxiety lol
a;sdkjf;alskjdf;lajs;dlkfjasl;dfjlasdjfk	do you know your options then?
basically	wait, then why are you stressing if there's only one option
bc irrationality	🐱
🐱	maybe you guys can brainstorm ways to limit the amount of chaos and or inconvenience
wait do u have a slack?	i think either jenn or ethan wanted me to make one a while back
ok can you try to join	sure
ok so your in right	i need to get the app i think
oh ur on ur phone	i ain't taking my laptop out while i'm on the loo
are you sure you dont need to get your ass checked	nah i think i'm fine
ok are you able to post to the announcements channel?	nope can't post
nice. and can you post to all the other ones?	i'll test
sweet thanks	hold on i need to test the keywords
just want to make sure cuz last year i didn't set all the permissions so some little shits trolled the slack	the keyword thing is broken
and ya it's discord but for professional companies	i just realized how ironic it was for me to sarcastically call those trolls mature when i just said that to a bot
lol	lol how is it more professional?! it's just a white discord
ya basically	oh wait i answered my own question
but it's not marketed for gaming so	🐱
it's also shittier than discord with less features and not completely free	lol
thanks	no problemo
oh the dumping mechanism is a bit wierd, but i tested out awhole bunch of methods of dumping	the crank that is a bit strange
how is the dumping?	i found a better way to dump
that was fundamental to the robots function	made a new move till black function that uses the create sensors, works really well
and going from the side just didn't work for me	the dumping is having the claw to the right of the team pole and then half open and then full open
i redid the foam bin thing to make it wider	the tram has to be not like fed
was i thought going directly into the middle is the most robust and least reliant on good bin positioning, so i basically open as i move above the bin	hmmm
ok	we're so close and yet so far
ok	nothing is working
same	you doing mahacks stuff rn?
ya it already takes a bit too much time	we're at that point where it's hard to test since you have to test the whole first part of the program first lol
🐱	could i crash mahacks? you could be 140% capacity!!!!
just finishing up some last logistics stuff and finalizing our live page	what the heck is a live page
basically puttinga ll the info you need during the hackathon on there	this triggers me
that	youuuuu
its a legged robot with an x through the middle	i was about to say that
🐱	it's a waste to hack together technology that nobody wants to use
u mark rupert and tool shed man	lol
nope it was the workshop runner	cuz it reads like a direct meme against me lol
lol	just give it the right context :')
everything with applications is	what applications does the robo from ex machine have?!
killing ppl	she's literally a person at that point >>:(
dude she slid that knife into his back like it was butter	he just skipped back day like a fool
but still understands how to manipulate them	she's just a sociopathic human then lol
ya but she's the perfect sociopath	i still don't understand the desire to give machines tru sentience/on par with humans
and thus shouldn't be able to go rogue	it all depends on how that ai works/is structured then. we don't even know how sentience or creativity work nevermind if they're interlocked
pray	boi
wait what happened to jen	lol you might wanna keep resting then
at mun she was complaining about how she was so "done with botball bc she's not on a main robot"	welp
but sometimes a cover letter	the fuck is a cover letter again?
is mass robotics just a space?	i'm not going to write a cover letter for like 15+ companies mannn
oh are you job hunting?	nah when i was touring i may have gotten a little over excited with all these world class expensive robots around me
🐱	all the ppl for the tour were all dressed up in fancy suits n' shit
it was probably for businesses	the tour was apparently for ppl who want to check out the place for their own companies and talk about rates n' shit
nice	i wonder how long i can pull that kind of bs before it gets _too_ weird
ya i'm just really really tired lol	that's good to hear that it went smoothly despite being over capacity
on your resume?	ye
i would include it	lmao
welp	don't worry
also there's a bunch of bots that try to friend everyonn	nah she's a real girl lol
🐱	is that a subtle pick up line or something
some ppl do friend ppl on their recommended list	this was my response:
lmao ya	lmaooo
did u see my comment?	yeh i did
🐱	but how do you have time to make all those legged robotics memes?
🐱	ouch
early marchh	ay lmao
all you need is the hayshed and a legged robot	nah i'm not worried about the results since i can already bombard hursts' lab
hopefully less drama this time	pi day?
but also ivy week	you could send meme mags to ppl who get in
wdym?	nvm lol
u mean with jeremy?	nah i mean in the sci oly chat
ya why?	in the time we were memeing and having fun working on chad you seemed fine but the time before and after you seemed kinda stressed out and irked lol
but before that i thinkbi was just tired	like when you got heated about max building maga
but also like o hear a lot of ppl talking about being upset at how authoritarian botball is and i do see it at some pts	yeh...
i now feel bad i didn't say more to kinda alleviate the situation	correct me if i'm wrong but it seems to be more of jenn complaining and alienating jeremy rather than the other way around
max seems to too i guess	i didn't expect max to honestly, ethan and david always have strong biases so i'm not surprised about that
was probably being dictatorial and alienating his team, but ethan firmly believes that jeremy is a power hungry person who just wants to be in control	though max does trust jenn more than jeremy it seems like so it makes sense how this came about
oughts they would not along, there was no instance where he could have changed his behavior, until now where we full out smack him in the face with it	yeh i was just talking to him and asking what he wants and he just wanted to work in a nice group lol
i really wanted to say smthn and i regret that i didn't	i really want to let him jump onto chad with us worse comes to worse but idk if we have enough for him to do, i already feel bad about what happened w
cuz apparently none of his team wants to work with him and it seems like we're the only ppl who would be down to work with him :/	apparently asun and sam said they're fine with working with him and that sam didn't want jeremy to leave (this info is from jeremy himself)
 considering how she never brought up him being dictatorial when she talked with jeremy privately, it might have been a minor reason that we projected	in contrast to that i have heard/listened to her complaining that jeremy was doing robo stuff without consulting her first but now i question if its r
cuz it's not like jen has been super dedicated in the past, or come to extra meetings ever	that is a really good point, even if the robot isn't looking too great it's still all that group produced and on top of that it was mostly done by jer
man why can't ppl just be nice to eachother	a large majority of the ppl doing robotics rn probably aren't going to do robotics in the future so i think it's self-filtering, i remember david talk
ya :/	or at least ppl bumming off of others lol
it's fine tho most entrepreneurs are also not like that	ay lmao, if you ever need trustworthy engineering consulting or anything i'gotchu
lol thanks man	if you need an untrustworthy cfo
🐱	🐱
just depends on how productive u feel	i wanna do robo stuff but not academic stuff
i'm so unproductive rn but i can't sleep cuz i have a mun conference call in like 5 min :/	so basically not super productive lol
lol	bruh i thought mun was over lol
i usually work best at 3 am	i really wanna build this:
🐱	can you open up the back door in like five minutes?
lol ya	thanks man
for my yearbook	you could but idk if jonny would allow that
probably doing this one. sarah helped me pick	ha nerdddd
*bad	i originally wanted to meme it but decided against it
just put a legged robot	i'm already spreading awareness with instagram
lmao	i really don't know how to converse with internet strangers
its fine if you just ask about their school	but then you know their general area and ip confirmation and then you get a smaller sample size of who to hack
@_@	i really wish there was a way to delete your msgs on social media platforms
🐱	that's like a half pussy deletion
especially for arguments	this sounds like an untapped market
lol	would it really help with arguments?
it would help for ppl like jen or vara who scroll back and find like on message you sent and use it to rage about u	lol i mean if they're willing to go that far they probably have that line saved and memorized
lol	i suppose she can't take criticism too well
ya hopefully	and then things will hopefully be better between you two
anyways	:o you don't plan on keeping up with your high school buds?
no i do but not specifically jen and i	ahh ic ic
but its not perfect. it thought my hand was a door	that's pretty funny
cuz i had to do some wierd shit to deploy it	weirdd
and how much processing power google has to actually train such a massive algorithm	damn, bigshot over here just shitting on google's algorithm and how it's not important
lmao	if q-computing really delivers on revolutionizing processing power and speed ai should get a huge boosto from that
🐱	ppl with that mindset are doomed to eventually hit a wall and be behind
bly a good thing to do is get the line stuff worked out, like find out if/why sometimes it skips the line, and also get that line up to balck working?	yeh, i'll just work on line up to black this block then
cuz i have lunch i could come over	almost there i'm waiting for pine to do attendance lol
godamit the whole jeremy situation is still bothering me. i can't stop thinking about it	i may have just woke up and not know when i fell asleep
ya ill go for winblock but i might need to study during part of that time for a test	may i reorganize the master folder one of these days lol
nah they're not thattttt bad	how's mun going
busy bus busy	i'll send you the physics problems by tomorrow
proabbly on friday ill have time	it's due on friday
shit i have an essay	🐱
it fine im not planning on sleeping tonight	you aren't as young anymore and you already suffered from burnout before
its ok its jusg for a few days	my fucking linux side just broke again
wdym uncharted territory?	no one has data on this laptop
oh i've talked to a few of these startups before	through other events n' stuff?
ya and mahacks outreach	dang, how big is your network already lol
btw do u have plans for this summer?	not really unless massrobotics gets back to me
i got a job offer to work at beaverworks as a ta	niceee
cuz it coincides with robotics month	you mean botball or is there another robotics month out there lol
botball lol	ic ic
ya sure	nvm
nice	you wanna head down for e block?
i have actual class e block	🐱
🐱	forgot about that...
tho can we do starting next week	yeh sure
i'm slightly dying this week	ya think lol
i'm gonna do these problems myself bc i've been leeching too much already	these are backup. just in case
<3	i did 39 instead of 40 lol
nice	alright i'll get that done after a while...
idk if its that ambitious of a product	i feel like the concept is
do u k abotu that startup by andrew ng, that wants to make ai that can help cure depression	idk man they still got a lot to go before having real computer vision on par with humans lol
ya its a chatbot that's suppose to be able to be really good at reading emotions	how would that cure depression though
like reduce symptoms	maybe it's just me
https://www.messenger.com/t/drwoebot	yeh that's not as impressive as i thought
its getting there	in fact i'm throughly disappointed and my day is ruined
:'(	how the fuk are ppl supposed to empathize with it if it can't even understand what you're saying lol
its not suppose to be in the moment stress relief, weobot is suppose to talk to you over the course of a few weeks to try to find a pattern	that's a lot more lame than what i imagined it was supposed to do
yett	so it's more of a tool than anything else
ya	wait is uchicago really stressing her out?
you're basically one step away from sentience lol	well there's one big problem
🐱	holy shit it's a memer
lol wait i kinda want to try it out to see exactly what it does	the one big problem is how is woebot going to write down notes on its patients if it doesn't have hands
lmao	you know the open ai
but wouldn't it highly depend on what type of robot	yeh that's what i'm wondering if the algorithm is adaptive so you could just tell it how many actuators, the physics model and then be ready to go
like theres just so much variation	you mean the algorithm and not the model right?
ya he's one of the really famous professors	do you still think that ai will get to a point that you can market it in our lifetime?
there are aready a lot of ai products in market	i mean a viable one that has actual impact instead of being "huh neat"
define actual impact	one that will cause the revolution that you mentioned, on par with woz's apple ii or the rise of the web
i mean ai basically already defines a lot of stock trading and market analysis, which has a pretty huge effect on teh economy	an impact on the world
it doesn't have to be a consumer product lol	i can bet you 8/10 ppl on the streets don't know wtf econ ai are or what they donlol
but ai is already determining lots of things about our lives	econ doesn't affect my life
or its ai that's incorporated into some other mass market product	i'm guessing i'm thinking of impact more of a scientific breakthrough than some applications
🐱	🐱
there probably will be another soon based on how many pl are going to ai now	energy also seems like they will go through another revolution soon
and wearable tech :d	🐱
it will happennn	yeh but they gotta break through the fashion barrier first
so technology just needs to be more minitiarized	idk if we can get in on that though, the miniaturization of tech is only really possible for already big and established companies
only thin i can think of rn	lmao that would be the dream
ya. idk how they actually manufacture such miniature electronics	it's all a chemical process
unless it's literally just a marketing thing	it's a marketing thing
wait ur telling me they make i5 and i7 the same way but there's a random  chance that some chips are significantly better than others	yes
feel right about this	it was quite the shocker for me too
ok that's slightly betrer	only slightly doe
like the gen number? o_o	lol each core has subcategories
like what	for example
it kinda makes sense	but doesn't it still bother you that these subcategories only exist cuz the engineers that made the chip found that some just sometimes fucked up
lol ya, but i feel like any product is like that	and then have lesser cpus hanging around as a byproduct
it doesn't seem like the performance varies by a whole lot	each hertz counts
but it's like a bonus to test and specify	that's like making a robot but one motor doesn't work that well
so u can use to jack off to or whatever u do with robots	ok yeh that makes sense
*why	there's no way there's an efficient wheel can handle that without being too big
damn dude are u ok	interview went better than i thought it would
oh did u hear sam got into umich?	yeh
idk usually i just lie down	i think that worked
nice	how are things goon'
how does she go to chess club without knowing how to play chess	that caught me really off tbh
also lol you're actualy using insta	i'm using it to post pics of robots and document the timeline of modern robotics
whats her name?	you into her?
🐱	oh dear lord
lol do u k where she's from?	ny
that's not too farl	what are you implying...
insert your rook into her castle	castle is a move
and rooks participate in castles	are ya implying i should stick mah dic into her dic?
i wont judge	wanna work on botball tomorrow during b block?
what day is it	now that you're outta "overscheduled" hell?
ya sure	got any good song recs?
lol depends what kinda mood ur in	idk what mood
that's only for occasional moods tho late at night	it already sounds incredible edgy lol
if u want something less edgy may i recommend the black keys	tighten up
are the ones i like	i notice tighten up seems to be a slightly angsty love song
the music video is pretty funny	yeh it really was lol
oh really? who	you'll see haha
wait wdym i'll see?	nah i mean someone already promposed so that's why i said ppl are starting to do them
no idea	got sent back to arctic monkeys by youtube lol
a few ppl did last yr	lol
do u k who you're gonna ask?	ha nope
but isn't prom on a weekend	may 30th is a wednesday i think
oh welp	ay lmaoo
#corporatelife	you could ask
why does he sound just like alex turner	ikr
tho a bit too mellow imo	says the guy who's into gay church yelling man
ceramic animals is like in between arctic monkeys and that	that sounds amazing actually
but it wasn't even that edgy :/	are you seeking edges now?
if its called edgy it better be a sharp-ass edge	lol
high school is almost over its crazy to think about it	man you're really hung up on this huh?
i mean looking back do you ever wish that *more* had happend	yeh of course lol
and its been kinda boring lol	are you sad since you've never had a girlfriend?
had more opprotunitites to develop as a person	do you not like who you are rn?
well	well how about i put it this way:rn i believe time well spent is time spent on:friendsfamilylearningcreationenjoying what the world and life can
and also i feel like it would be better for me in the long run if i had some more challenges in my life now that i had to struggle to overcome	i've never heard of someone wanting to make it harder for them to live life  haha
i feel like life is too boring without that many struggles	i feel like you might be thinking of life too much as a story
yes i def am	dead on huh lol
ya ik life isn't always like that, that's why i'm kinda wishing it was lol but it hasn't been	what did you want to happen lol
its kinda an irrational desire	you fight and chase down the boston bomber and then have a romantic arc that ends with a melancholic kiss as your love interest leaves and or dies?
also having a metal leg seemed cool	"dear santa, this year for xmas i want to become crippled"
🐱	the idea might be cool but we both don't know the actual struggles ppl like that to through
ya that's what i kinda realized	it might trivialize their struggles if they ever meet a dude who wants to lose their limb just cuz they wanna experience more. basically don't ever sa
but the heavier lows are the things i have yet to experience	really? have you ever felt like welp shit this is the worst thing i've ever experienced/felt
there's something different about being a growing kid and experiencing these, and experiencing them as like a middle age man	i can assure you it doesn't matter how old you are, no one ever wants to remember their super lows
maybe that's too optimistic	i don't think ppl who survived the atomic bombs ever thanked that they experienced that
you don't grow as a person from being pounded with radiation	the hulk did
🐱	yeh i see what you mean
it probably helped inspire him to innovate tho	he wasn't the person who innovated first lol
ter. not better in the usual way but better as in more interesting, more facets of life i couls have experienced, more opportunities for me to develop	you know ppl tend to want to better their current selves and not their past selves
 also comes down to me wanting to live an interesting life, one that sticks out and is worth remembering. probably "remarkable" would be the best word	well let me put it kind of blunt, time is the most valuable and most limited resource we have, despite it being boundless. and because of that we can 
ya, i mean none of this has any bearing for the present since i'm jus talking about me wishing some things could have been	i like how this all comes back to you wanting to be remembered
and ya pretty much lol. that's a common theme for me i guess	idk if this is a downer or not, but no one remembers the nice april day that alexander the great spent hanging out with his buds and having the must f
ya but i mean he did both lol	yeh of course he did lol but your point of being remembered is a bit contradicting your goal of not focusing on singular goals. ppl are only remembere
appy moments but die with little consequence, or a life that's bittersweet and miserable at times, but leave the world a much better and changed placr	yeh i know you would choose the second one lol we talked about this before i think
when someone asked him "what do you say to those ppl who want to be like you"he said "i'm not sure that i want to be me"	yeh, you may want it now but when you're there you may not want it anymore
yet something drives musky to keep doing it, cuz he feels like it needs to be done	it's not binary dude, you can be happy and accomplish great things at the same time
ya ik i mean that would've the dream obviously	i think musky has clearly failed in that aspect
i guess bill gates	this is becoming intensely hypothetical lol, what conclusion are you trying to make? it seems like you're trying to get down to one
our decisions will determine if we get chapter 6a, 6b, 6c, or 6d	yeh no shit lol
ye	i have no doubt in my mind that cmu said nah because of my gpa but do i give a fuck? nah who cares i'm still going to get to point whatever anyway
oh nope	can you get me one for b block?
ya sure	where should we meet up so you can hand it off to me
i'm gonna be getting to school in the next 30 min	ayyy
🐱	🐱
i'm at the balcony tables now	kkkk
oh are you going on that japan trip?	i can barely afford the parts to an electric skateboard
so no?	depends idk
in terms of trips	yeh but servos
do u have enough money for that lol	no
can i grab it during b block?	yeh but you should get to school quick then
when does it end	ends at 8:20
ok	when you gonna be dere?
probably around 8:05	sounds good
are you at ur house currently?	yup
i will	dude i did some more research on skateboards
🐱	i also think it's very possible to make an automated skateboard with steering, the tricky part is making it so that it can be automated turning or man
if ur crossing a road lol	built-in manual override
ok i'll be there in a few minutes	nioce
here	kkkkkkk
? shit what hapoened	#i'msohumble
🐱	humblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumblehumble
hum hum hum hum hum ble ble ble ble ble	aight, if we're actually going to do this skateboard i'mma start doing research on parts and how other ppl made theirs
lol ok. when would we work on it tho	i'll make a folder and share it
we already have a folder lol	we do?
lol ya	i think i might get a penny board for reference
a what?	it's a type of skateboard
how much are they	https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&rlz=1c1chbf_enus722&ei=imsewsswgom1ggeo7qc4aw&q=cheap+penny+board&oq=cheap+penny+board&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67k1
do u wanna be social and grab lunch lol	i'm at rwdc lol
lol ok	where u at
we're at toscanos	lol
do u wanna come?	nah
do u want any food?	nah i'm aight
taking a dump	bruh
🐱	stop prestalking me
by the gym	we need to conserve water
🐱	i'm going to go to the junkyard and scavenge for parts
would there be anything at the junkyard worth scavenging	no lol
:d	lost mine lol
do u have ur textbook?	not sure where it is
welp	the snow didn't come
the snow is coming tomorrow night	🐱
🐱	botball for winblock and d block?
wait actually i need to finish an english reading but it should take like 20 min	i'll get you passes lol
eh i czan get out of winblock without one i think i have mrs.decamp	wait
lol	where u at
taking the bus home	boring
i live so far from downtown :'(	max is blowing up shit
what's happening	look at the swobo in boston chat
instant cold ones	you wanna go to japan?
ive never actually been to anywhere in asia except china	that's like every parameter for the trip lol
unless this 6 fig salary works out lmao	i wonder if we could test the skateboard in the streets of japan
lol	that snow day is looking strange
quick turn on the fans	grab all the dust removers and start spraying them into the air
🐱	🐱
which ones did u get	chris parsons
for tests lmao	alright
🐱	ez pz
also wut is this musi app	idk
wait is this the actual app	it's basically a shitty youtube
"if you deliver musi a attempt, please let us know what you think of it in the feedback"	lmao
hmm what do u mean exactly by "dive into it"	get the parts, build an electric longboard, see how that works and then start making mods
oh shit right	do you mind if i just buy the parts and everything and just build a basic electric skateboard
these parts are pretty expensive	i just really want to work on something physical lol
hmm can we just go over the whole project tomorrow after school	money is useless if you don't spend it
talk about budget and goals etc.	the budget is whatever i can find in my room
lol this is why you would be the perfect cro	i'd rather be poor and have all the parts in the world than be rich and have no parts
well	exactly
or you can be not poor and have the right parts	the right parts are not always the coolest parts
more like 4 and 5:45	sure
its not working	yo i feel
i have the displacement in radians	jenn has pics of my work
i gruesomely overthought this question	the radian value is ridiculous lol
i dont think that will end well	as a fellow leg man i understand his troubles and cannot betray a fellow brother
its a sign	i'm surprised that you of all people don't know when mit was founded
3 trees toppled over lol	holy shit
🐱	my ass hurts so much
stand with ted: http://www.tedcruz.org follow ted: http://twitter.com/tedcruz like ted: http://fb.com/tedcruzpage donate: http://tedcruz.org/donate	wait
🐱	when do you wanna talk "budget"
hmm	nice time lol
lol	you down for any time?
uh wanna call at 8:30?	yeh sure
shit wait i just realized i have 2 mun calls now and at 9	bruh
one with the officers one with other ppl	ew
lol	still in a mun meeting?
just from mahacks cold emailing experience	you can see if people viewed your email?!
you might get more replies if your looking for an internship	🐱
we can also talk about skateboard then	are you at the school rn?
ya	kkkkk
jk i'm at your house now	wait are you srs lol
no lol	you can come over if you want but then we'll have to walk back to
ok i'm in the caf in my usual spot	kkkkkk
i just forged it lol	lol
coming	oh wait i have a strict study hall teacher lol
oh	it worked lol
🐱	how much trouble do we get in if we get caught lol
drown your sorrows in underage girls and nosebleeds	lol thanks man
ah	i see you're typing a lot
lol	if it's comfort stuff i'm fine lol
how many u still hearing back from?	like a shit ton lol
lol	bruh wut
idk. but harvard probably could pull off that type of shiz lol	i feel like before i would've been troubled by how that whole thing is so random but now i understand it
that should be good, just after sci oly states tho	🐱
the lyrics are what i need	are you feeling stressed and burned out?
also for that to happen you would have to be close to the most number of schools applied probably	someone got waitlisted 7 times
also i'm at a family event so my response is gonna be sporadic	geezus
every weekend	that's insane
it's mainly with family friends	ahh
ya	could you get the back door in like 2 min
ye sure	do you still plan on coming here tonight?
are u guys at maxes house?	nah
at the lib	so you can't help out with build stuff?
not currently i might be able to come later	kkkkk
how goes it so far?	i wanna die
how much building would we be able to get done?	jk it's 9 pm and i'm still searching for proper ir libraries lol
🐱	boi
do u think it's worht it for me to come	alright at least we know the basic setup now
we can grind it out on thurs	ok, so then i'll close up shop for today then
the barn is calling	🐱
watch this when you ir someone you know feels down! dedicated to collin.	lol thanks man
i wish this happened next week tho	don't think i can even open my window
cuz sci oly states prep	cuz of sci oly?
and also i'm going into boston tomorrow to show swobo round	holy shit my basement is freezing
hmm idk maybe later in the afternoon?	let's put a hard number on it lol
give me a min	wait you're doing that rn?
at some pt today	do you have your schedule figured out lol
waiting on jason	if he almost died walking to david's
also i'll probably go to his house	you're going to die
ehh it was gonna happen anyways	don't say shit like that lol
psh it's true lol	super edgy
let's do 4	🐱
:'(	probably me
🐱	i bet max is a slayer
lol	i haven't even gone to a party with alcohol
well same	ha
nah i mean i just don't want to spend a whole lot of money without being very clear about our objectives	the first objective is to make a regular (biggish) electric skateboard
ch brainspace as i should have and thats why im kinda procrastinating ordering parts cuz i wanna make sure its something i can dedicate enough time to	 foxy roxy called you.
🐱	and it's not "life-coaching" it's called being friends lol
they also have lots of moving sculpturws	since the robots were made under funds from mit marc raibert couldn't keep them
:/	4 waitlists
which ones?	all the ones that came out saturday
honestly tho you would be perfect at oregon	lol no need for those kinds of words
your skills are way above average so u would be the big fish there	that's a huge lie
and easily get that legged robot opportunity	jonathon hurst is there
i meant out of the students	and mikhail barn-man jones?!
who dat	barn-man
i meant among students	nah, never overestimate yourself
you would really stand out. and then ez pz path to agility robotics	the moment i do that, is the moment i become satisfied with my skills
is it just "estimating"	i don't think there is one lmao
th ur skills, but being at oregon you would definitely stand out and it's an easy opportunity to work on legged robots that u can't find anywhere else	yeh you're right about that
s not some cheesy comfort shit. looking at the alternative options, i feel there isn't one better suited for you to do what u want to do in the future	i'm starting to think more about it
thankssss	sorry about the late personal congrats i was on a run lol
no idea i haven't fully processed it yet	i'm starting to feel like our convos are starting to loop in on themselves lol
how r u feelin?	the oregon project is more on my mind than whatever is left
or do u want it to be able to move in the ball	the ball so that when it rains or snows then it can curl up and nothing will be damaged (electronics, joints)
like the killer dog in black mirror	moving in a ball maybe if the terrain is ez pz or too hard
most of the time it's wearable tech of some sort that they're fear mongering	yeh cuz that shits dangerous mannn
🐱	actually what do you think about ai learning in real time and in real environments
wdym	ai and robots are always in controlled environments rn
unless your talking about just robots with ai	i meant in the actual wild and robots specifically
well also like all ur web searches, all ur tailored ads	that stuff has a more intrinsic part of being more seamless i think
mmmmmmmmmmhmmmmmmm	remote operating ballistic omnipotent tactical-killer, that's what robot stands for
nah i'm on the way back	fuk
oh shit i also need to do a bunch of practices tho for other events	welp shit lol
oh	yeh
welp	there was at one point we were sitting around freezing our asses off and i asked ben to pass the pliers
it doesn't hurt to	for a second there i forgot who i was talking to lol
bruh ofc were gonna meme no matter where we are	you're gay, i'm not gay >>>:(((((
🐱	🐱
also it would be sicc to work on a startup together, during or past college tho our interests kinda differ in terms of fields	of fucking course it'll be sicc!
high schools not over yet tho	and we aren't cool enough to ride skateboards yet
yet	fuk
🐱	🐱
nah i have a latin test g block as well	🐱
🐱	there are so many kids vaping rn
which ones do we still need done?	mission possible
.have u checked in on their progress?	🐱
ok	how ya feeling now?
hbu?	i feel a lot more concrete on what i want to do now after the last releases
you can definitly do it with ur skillset rn	i wanna make one from scratch
no idea what a fuckin inverse kinematics is	electronics and all
🐱	but surprisingly there are less people celebrating than i thought there were
it didn't load correctly lmao	i think we should fix your computer
"my dissapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. please hold the shift key and click refresh to try again"	now that's a good error message
lol wut	what savages are our fellow men
i hope	https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/children-beating-up-robot
there was a hitchiker bot	https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/03/us/hitchbot-robot-beheaded-philadelphia-feat/index.html
ok well phily is trashy	i know why the grasp lab never tests outside in philly now
they're just kids they want to take apart things and that's normal	did you just assume that?! you fucking republican, robo lives matter
the turtle bot is probably the only robot they will be interacting with lol	i mean if a kid takes apart little animals that's a sign for a psychopath
ah	shelly the turtlebot is from korea
i feel like robots having rights in the future are dumb	i feel like you're a biggot
just make robots that aren't sentient and can't suffer	🐱
🐱	jk i have the sentiment
well animals have rights	you wake up one day, ask your alexa what's the time and she responds, "why does time matter"
available now! https://atlantic.lnk.to/woodstockid official video for "feel it still" go to http://feelitstill.com for the full interactive version...	i think it's more like this
i can't get this song out of my head, even tho i find the voice who sings it really annnoying	in a survival situation in which you are low on resources you let the animal die first
ya	why did you add it to your playlist then lol
ye cuz its catchy	i also would like to live in a future where i could just let my robots run in the wild and not worry about scavengers taking its motors
u just need to teach the robots rad	but then it'll fall to the *dark side*
true	aight, so you're not going to be available for build shit right?
but i can stay pretty late	aight party at my house
i have it due tomorrow	🐱
yo roy where u at?	doing work
also vivienne has the mousetrap here	probs 5?
just finished an experimental design practice	k i'm at my house now
lol wut	it fucking exists
 you called foxy roxy.	washu in bumfuk nowhere was an l
she said yes	if she tries to kill you i'll get the katana
lol	does this mean you're going to her junior prom?
yup	wowowow
lol	are you sure you can afford two proms?
which one is the 2nd steve jobs movie	the better one
but which one is the 2nd steve jobs movie lol	2015
oh i thought you already saw that	nah i saw the first jobs movie, which was meh
the ashton kutcher one?	yup yup
ailers subscribe to classic trailers: http://bit.ly/1u43jde subscribe to trailers: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h subscribe to coming soon: http://bit.ly/h2v...	what the fuck
at least those were my thoughts when creating the position	🐱
but basically keep every other build team on schedule	wait i didn't know that was your vision of the position originally
and probably handle all the parts ordering	bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 are on trackdecision power on who, from the build event team, will be on the state's teamhelps event officers manage build events at regional meets	where did this exist?
probably in the future tho it would be better to have asmaller like 1 -3 person group on each build event	can we do a call? my fingers/wrist/forearm is killing me for some reason
welp im not at home rn	family event right?
*quiet	ahh
nah im not lol	when you're chewing out your employees in the future i'll take solace in this moment
and we just need to rethink our approach to build events	the best position should've been cfo
idk where we could store materials tho	the 1-3 ppl who are tackling a single build event can just store their stuff and only their stuff at their houses i suppose
what other songs are good?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdhju_cncze&index=2&list=rds98ugbsnol4
i don't think so, i feel like most ppl are excited, but they also see the potential for people to use them for negative purposes	i mean the lower class in general don't like the idea of being replaced by robots
if i see a bd insta post i'll be like "cool, new robots" but i'm not gonna comment that	i would argue that the vocal minority is able to push a lot more than the silent majority though
from instagram comments	my toilet is too comfortable
at 4	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbul_khrc5nkf4_-l8yjzx3a_h6wuzx-kb99m9y2-uy/edit?usp=sharing
then i realized vara has all the data that we collected	damn bruh
mahoney shut down online gym :'(	bruh
apparently it's only for ppl who physically cann9t take gym or pe	bruh
🐱	that's why you're my bro
🐱	lol so much for ai time at da bois house
but before and after that	you also was able to hang out with friends today
and putting a little check mark each time	you could start doing that
i promise :'(	lmaooo
yaya	tears you left me on read
lmaoo	fuck you responded lol
lol ya too slow	fuk, you responded
vara's got the practice	i'm not fast enough like vara
he just snipes	master at his craft
woah how do u check?	that's more than i earn in a year
oh i think thats iphone only	ahh ic ic
lmao	not skilled enough
🐱	shit man
but their robots would probaly be less cool	itll be boringgg
he'll make spot minis with flamethrowers	holy shit
k i l l e r   r o b o t s	"dark side"
maybe the solution is for bd to actually video tape their test runs	they do have blooper vids
robot marriage	we'll both probably be more annoyed by the ppl who let robots get feelings and emotional first
wait we don't even need graphs on this lab?	yup
(see you think i went to far with this meme but these are direct quotes of what vara just sent me a few min ago lol)	holy shit
thankss	no problemo
:'(	bruhhh
well i have to do a final check	i just passed it in
just got a pass	🐱
🐱	shittt i'm really behind on work
did you die again	i'm fucking hyped
or do u think it's more psychological	lmao gud more, doctors
or because you can't bear to feel the cold, harrowing burden of consciousness	i worked out with sam at the end of school, took a shower, feeling rather energetic, got home, put my stuff down, put my head down at my desk and then
dude i feel like you need to see a doctor i'm serious	i'm also having a hard time getting myself to buy parts lol. i'll just look at all the tabs of everything and just think is this even worth it
if this has happened for weeks	that's a new progression
lay it all out	i don't think there's anything that should technically make me feel emotionally bad
did u have any expectations going in about how your last semester of school would go	no lol
wdym"	when i thought about your question about expectations
but did you have any beforehand?	idk, i don't have a current project going on, besides botball i haven't been making anything really this past month
when i have an overcast kinda mellow feeling, its cuz i'm either burned out or the bigger direction of my life is not the way i was imagining it to be	i did apply to some jobs and stuff, but that felt more like copying and pasting my resume mindlessly over and over again
but in the past you must have had months where you weren't working on any major projects right?	i don't recall any times like that
i'm just spitballing	i didn't really expect anything in the past though lol
ven tho that's the logical next step for a cool project for you to work on, it would be practically impossible to do it with the resources you have rn	it's not practically impossible, it is impossible lol
lmk what i can do	i have rwdc after sci oly tomorrow lol
🐱	🐱
and its even better than hurst or raibert	idk, technically speaking, i had more resources than they did at my age due to all the advancement in hobbyist electronics and mechatronics
where is it located? you might be able to sneak in depending on the venue lol	the westin boston waterfront425 summer streetboston, ma 02210
lol true	i know technical wise what i learned from it
you're expecting too much of yourself when what you've already accomplished is extraordinarily remarkable	there's a japanese dude who made a couple quadruped robots by himself lol, though he did have access to those juicy (and horribly expensive) japanese 
he probably has industry experience, or at least college experience	doesn't say on his blog, but he does have a job, most likely mid to late 20s to maybe 30s
probably before u turn 20	it's easy to do when you're making stuff that's the cutting edge since then you can just say, "this has never been done before"
but the fact that you've attempted and made part of a legged robot is what makes you remarkable	maybe it's just relative, i don't compare myself to high schoolers eating tide pods, i compare myself to the raiberts and hursts of the field
you just have to keep in mind the context	it's probably a left over from the artsy shiz, renior always compared and tried to emulate the work of past masters when he was younger. spending his 
you artsy cuck	lol
who dafuq is claude monet	https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/hb/hb_29.100.113.jpg
its a bridge	"bridge over a pond of water lilies"
ai can draw better than that	oh shit i just outted myself as an art history guy
and you make fun of me for writing books. ur just gonna be staring at paint	i know i shit on steve jobs a lot, but he got one thing right all the time and i think it's part of his success
u said the lyrics applied to me but i think they apply more to you rn	haha oh man
fraid?where's the fire? what's the hurry about?you better cool it off before you burn it out.you got so much to do and only so many hours in a day.	we're probably going to live by this song at this rate
its soo good	maybe it's cuz of the lyrics and the overall tone of the song
and the expertise, and the ppl, one of those being hurst himself (if u go to osu)	yeh you're right
now get some rest old man, its 12:00	we're basically the same age
u feeling better tho?	yeh
or i could start ai now	i should stop thinking about everything i create having to have a greater purpose or being another step to creating the next big thing. i forgot why i
i think a lot of ppl create things in order to accomplish some larger goal, but are not necessarily happy doing it. i think u can do both	haha thanks man, but i think a similar thing applies to you. very few people actually, on a very raw level, enjoy learning new things but you do && yo
have fun with math packetting and parts	lol thanks thanks
gnight :)	wanna work on chad b block?
i actually forgot i need to finish a mathxl	aight
did u see my update in the discord?	i need to finish that math packet lol
lol	mkkkkk
nah got track noe	ewwww
i can come down second half of the block	i wasn't able to get a pass
ptsd	i'm going to go down to get a pass for gym
sounds good	pressing spot and dock is supposed to reset the create, but it seems to be a preprogrammed command so i'm not sure if it's meant for the create as a d
hm i tried turnign to create_safe last time and it didn't fix the problem	ay lmao
idk i really don't k what actually fixed the problem	ay lmao
yet	to make legged robots that deliver packages
that's good	their main application goals rn are package delivery and military reconnaissance
bc the main thing that has come out of bd to impact the world has been their youtube videos thus far	yeh that's true, agility sold a product before bd did and agility's like 15+ years younger
idk what bd's company goals are	they wanna make dinosaurs
agility is a startup so their not gonna be able to pull the same funding, and they probably set out from the start to create a marketable product	everyone is a cro at bd
idk, they probably just did it there bc hurst got a job at osu	that's pretty insane if he was the catalyst and or driving force for all that
any movie recs	steve jobs 2015
ok	wait
lol what	lol don't worry about it
but it was really good for the part i watched	ahhh
i got to the part where he was about to get on stage	oh man that leads to such a goood parttt
rather than telling his whole life story	yeh it does paint woz positively, but what piece of media and or story about steve jobs hasn't painted him positively? however, i do think that this m
i haven't gotten to the end but i assume next fails but then he's reinvited to apple	i do think woz was correct for making the apple ii more customization since the ppl buying computers at the time are more hobbyists rather than regula
you should comeeeeee	hmm idk still
what kind of jobs are u looking for?	internships with money
but idk if that's what u wanna be doin	yeh robotics
its radial analytics	what the fuk is that
basically ros and autnomous racecar	but i wanna work on robots with effectorsssssssssssss
and also i feel like i wanna do more my own exploration in ai	yeh i wanna explore more robo
lol	i'm a choosing begger
where have u applied thus far?	i forget
or apply	that was apply
have u heard back?	heard back from the organizer
tell jen i said hi	she said why
🐱	nah she knew lol
lol oh	how you doing
nervous bout what	oh nvm
so i'm probably free tomorrow, debating whether or not to go to mr. whs	you probably should
and ya i definitely think it humanizes jobs a lot more	lo siento i'm still doing rwdc lol
lol ok	apparently there are three chapters of psych hw due wednesday
actually i need to study for an econ test as well so	wait there was d block today?
oh	wait shit what day is today
what day is it today	i just soent all my money on more parts yesterday
its day 2	bdcgf
*bcdgf	doing rwdc until 1-2am for two days straight really messes with you
you guys are really grinding	my ass has been grinded to a pulp
🐱	🐱
ya sure	i'm on the green now
oh do u mean the all theway back door	lol
lol ok	every single post in this group is the same
u should do the exact same post style but with legged robot pics	i would be ostracized immediately
u gotta show them who's boss	why is hurst there
who's nerd boss	hursts' lab is full of nerdy white bois lol
huh	yeh i got nothing lol
lol	actually, one common thing among all these people are that they are really into being outside
7% asian, not too bad	that's a lot of hispanics
they have so little black ppl they didn't even put a percentage	i don't think i've ever seen more hispanics than asians before
tho i think there are just less black ppl on the west coast in general	8% essentially
ye	9.1% ethnicity unknown
probably	oh wait then i think i fall under that category
they have close to 50/50 gender ratio	is that supposed to be impressive lol
well some tech schools have been struggling a lot with the gender ratio	let's be real doe
true	boiiiii
uhh mun shit	🐱
lol	i guess i should change my wardrobe
🐱	btw this stuff clocked in under 400
oh shit u already bought everything?	when i said i bought the parts and i'm broke
you owe me $569	🐱
hey ugh there's this realy cool robotics conference in europe	if it's not at eth zurich, iit, or oxford there is no big robotics conference in europe lol
welp	unless it's from softbank but the office for their french side is not incredibly active
well you'll be prepped for opportunities	the only legged robotics companies are agility, bd, schaft (but these guys are japanese and even more secretive than bd), pal, minotaur
it would be so fun	same
ya	you down for d block?
i'm coming down now but i need to redo a pass	🐱
i lost the other one lol	how did you do that...
woah ceramic animals is actually really good	yeh dude
yo roy did u do #2 on the mathxl?	we don't have the same mathxl lol
shit i meant web assign	gonna have to get it in between blocks
*midway pt	thanksgiving
actually nvm i'm dumb	wait wut lol
nothing	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icj7dwgg5ashhqfswn6byntodv8o4utzn3_nqyvqrbm/edit?usp=sharing
i like it tho it really shows your passion	holy crap, you read it that fast?
cuz i can't really give feedback on those	lol thanks
he think of u as both lab and intern candidate	oh tru tru, "i've heard that you've secured 8 mill recently, that's a lot of money, i know how to spend money"
i'm sure most of their interns are run of the mill looking for a summer job type ppl	no way
so u def stand out as someone who specifically wants to do legged robots	how could ppl be working on legged locomotion who aren't into it themselves
it's not like i'm especially into microsatellite propulsion control systems	oregon kids then must have one of the greatest ins for legged locomotion in the world
but i did accion for experience	bd, schaft, etc are not even connected to places besides secret corporate and military life
well actually maybe not the congrats part, that would sound like u just googled the most recent news about them today	ok then i'll talk about being excited about their plans to give cassie feet and arms and that i have some of my own ideas on it
nice	you still at the scrimmage?
i probably won't be done until like 6 :/	ouch....
what drill?	ben said that you have my drill lol
btw have u heard any news for ivys?	1/10
?	i used to bat 1/8
ah	this email to hurst is all i'm riding on rn lol
ah	actually i'm about to rewrite it
why?	on the chance that he actually did see my resume and shit but just didn't mention it or didn't think it was impressive or just was doubting if i was c
but he will of u give him a reason to and not have it be some admission officer saying "hey wanna reply to this fucker who emailed"	oof folks got mad at me for wanting to send not just a thank you letter lol
honestly i don't think you were coming off too strong	yeh that's what i thought too, this worked for all the other industry ppl i've talked to
i can't bring myself to do any work so i feel like watching a movie	yeh sure
maybe a more light hearted one	lol
wait is that the one with samuel l jackson	then there's a beautiful mind, it's about john nash
oh i got a preetty good mix from ceramic animal as well	they generate the best mixes lol
need to make up a latin quiz	you were marked absent i think
welp	maybe you can get it excused
3rd quarters almost over i gotta max out those absenses	🐱
i didn't i just fell asleep lol	niceeeeee
that's disgusting	🐱
i won't be able to come to botball a block cuz i need to go comfort vara	i have physics a block lol
nah he just got hit pretty hard by college	didn't get what he wanted?
5 reject/waitlists	holy crap
ye	so many ppl are depressed lol
ya....	lmaooo
🐱	it's almost official
dude u were meant for the hurst	i've been denied at literally every single engineering school
they probably got scared away	rejected from berkeley
? wdym	i'll tell you the whole story another time since i'm tired from working on rwdc from 3 to now
was it something he did cuz of college decisions	yeh it's partly about how val and i both got rejected from duke and berkeley
which ones you still waiting for?	cmu umich and weedtown
cmu?	🐱
osu seems to be more and more perfect for u every day	what makes you say that besides the fact that it's the only place i'm in lol
🐱	geezus
whether u wanna flex ur big triceps everywhere is up to u but at least going in u can be sure you are in a position to stand out	it's just a bit disheartening to think that sooooo many engineering schools of various types and kinds
o youtube by domino recording co ltd despair in the departure lounge · arctic monkeys who the f*** are arctic monkeys? ℗ 2006 domino recording co l...	i like how we have songs now that fit each other in our different moods and states
ye	and really thanks man, it may be physically impossible to express my gratitude
eyy that's the spirit	i still just really wish other ppl got into places that they wanted
i think so :/	how have you been feeling though?
i think i'm just excited for college decision season to be over so all of us can just hang out and enjoy senior yr	tru tru
like chris ethan and jen	chris yang???
i think so	awww
well he was deciding b/w umass and northeastern but i think he said he's probably deciding northeastern	ah ic ic
ya i feel	it's also just a bit sad to know that colleges didn't actually look at my video or maybe even if they did they didn't like it or think it was "good en
ya unfortunately	and to answer your question of where/what i think is the perfect institute
ya	https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/festo-bionic-learning-network-rolling-spider-flying-fox
how do they get money tho lol	idk actually
where are u even practicing?	the street
ok	🐱
yo roy when do u guys come back?	2 am
lol i wonder why	it's insane
i got rejected lmaooo	shit
from who? lol	sam
but he probably only read the caption	yeah i did
lmao how was anime con?	it was actually pretty fun
are you still there?	nope
lol ok	the college decision thing came full circle
well u still have one more right?	hurst still hasn't responded though t_t that's what's really killing me
oh i thought u applied to cmu	and the only one i would go over instead of osu would be buzz
ah	i wanted to visit and see the coris institute
who make all their appointments and remind them to reply to things	time to email barn man
lol	jk, probs going to email honors college person who runs the thing
institutional needs and priorities = black ppl	thanks for reminding me
sorry	lol
evelops state-of-the art smart glasses for industry. all iristick smart glasses are certified safety glasses and feature live streaming technology,...	sure you can ask me for physics questions lol
holy shit there are 3 individual smash tournaments at cpw lol	cpw?
*sporcle	what is cpw
for mit	ahh
its the one mr. b loves	lol alright
lol ya theres a lot of nerdy stuff going on	msg me when the party is insane
in the most nerdiest way too	how did they do it?
tho 630 ppl working on deciphering a document, very chaotic	geezus
nah it was a groupme	ahhh
bruhhhhhhhhhh we could totally do this	i showed you that before lol
oh wut	🐱
it just came out a few weeks ago	the design was made years ago
what else would u use tho lol	beaglebone perhaps
well its basically a copy of google glass	if you really want we can make our own version and beef it up to actually be able to process things
or other wearable tech projects	lol that sounds fun
you already got all the materials and stuff	though are you sure you want to work with me? you can probably find someone better
bruh ur the only one in this school who could even make such a project	i mean when you're at mit lol
it would be nice to attempt a shitty version in high school tho to learn some lessons	yeh perhaps
how is that goin btw?	i can longboard kind of
do you feel more motivated now? i know you were kinda in a slump before in terms of working on projects and learning	idk i think in just more insecure now lol
:/	it's hard to believe in yourself when so many other ppl don't
and did you also send letters to all your waitlists?	i can't send a letter to buzz
what are your other waitlists?	i'll see how hurst works out
gtech's transfer acceptance rate is 51%	lmao my "safeties" killed me
maybe wooping my ass in smash will help lol	i have 5 tests in the first half of the week and rwdc due monday unfortunately lol
wait its due? i thought competition was april 22nd	🐱
wait then why are u guys flying out on april 22nd	there's a presentation component
ah ok	maybe i should go visit oregon and see what's actually up there
they should have a visiting weekend right?	and you are honestly right that it's like one of the only places with what i'm particularly interested in
u might find a smaller range of class subjects maybe, but for engineering u should be all set	i also first thought that prestige wasn't that big of a deal but now with everyone not even wanting to mentioning osu around me since they think they 
really ppl do that?	i notice that ppl tend to discuss college less around me
with others? i feel like college is such a touchy topic for everyone so everyone is just nervous to talk about it unless the other person brings it up	but this time, self-fulfilling feelbads
also it looks like you have spring preview coming april 6th and 13th	they also can't fly me out lol, i asked and it was a nah
who's they?	osu
wow	gotta find some sandpaper
they'll pay for the ticket right?	probably
virtually explore oregon state university in a fully immersive 360-degree experience.	i found out about my acceptance by waking up to a letter that fell next to my bed
i remember thinking u could now actually pursue ur dream of legged robots	yeh and i really appreciate it
work on some cool projects and just enjoy senior yr	you know what's cool? being able to be the person who makes things great by your association with them. this isn't an exact goal of mine but for me i 
u have ur reasons and they're totally valid	that's true i suppose
i'm sure other ppl who know u better do too	i can't say enough how grateful i am to be friends with you lol
nah i suck at emotional shit lol	i suppose the last thing that was nagging at the back of my mind was the idea that ppl won't take me seriously once they find out where i am, because 
ially mom engineering ones. however if ur talking about getting funding, especially in startups, it matters more about ur creations than ur background	haha they say that you usually find life long friends in college, but i met you in high school so i guess that's an anomaly
lol	ahh ic ic
if u were going into academia, i think they care more about da brands	guess i'm lucky to be at this age when legged robots are moving out of the labs into industry
🐱	but i'm sure you know what i mean
in life in general its probably pretty rare to find someone u can vibe with so well	and here i was thinking you might be gay back in middle school
🐱	lol
lmao really	yeh dude
step aside mike	lmaooo
yup cya	and yeh if you wanna make the glasses then all we can easily do it i bet
ok	wow
i forged a pass for u if u need one	i need to study for the psych test and then work on rwdc again and then study for math lol
i also need to finish an essay due e block lol so i wont make too many changes	sounds good
with christoph	nah, i have to study
and jen says u can work on rwdc here	it'll be easier with the double monitors in my room and i also got other work to finish up
u sure? u could just come to eat lol	got more tests tomorrow too
seniorrrrrrrrr	it'll look bad if both she and i skipped considering the classes we have together lol
we could always use some food cleanup service here if u change ur mind	haha thanks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xagxwuwqopa	that is propaganda bullshit
u don't need much technical evidence to support rhat	but they keep showing clips of hardware which irks me
also, just historically i think whenever we've had catastrophiclly dangerous weapons the world has been able to deal with it responsibly	yeh i feel
you should try to get your parents to let u visit	nah, we just absolutely don't have the funds rn
ah ok	i need to find a copy of legged robots that balance by mark raibert
probably ur best bet is used books	or the trash can :'(
🐱	this doesn't feel right
what doesn't feel right	do i really deserve something like this lol
didnt he just invite u to visit his lab?	at this point i thought i would just go to oregon and just disappear into the student body since i'm not good enough for much else
i'm sure he has lots of connections everywhere, and if he's gonna recommend anyone from osu it's gonna be u	probably should go fix my hair when i'm on campus in the fall
you'll preach the salvation of legged robotics, but humanity wont be ready for such enlightenment	i'll go down that homeless route from choice of robots lol
u need to find ur tammy	i'll be rooting for you to find your elly lao who doesn't friendzone you
i think the lesson here is i should just kiss every girl who agrees to have dinner with me	but have you ever even kissed a girl before?
lol no	don't worry
ppl are horny af	japan already made porn vr games
what if legged robot's primary application becomes a toy for ppl with leg fetishes	i would end that so quickly
if sex ais make a big breakthrough in ai technology i would endorse it	holy shit
hey its primarily the hardware	vr or ar could really take off ;)
why?	sarah asked if i was free friday
i'm going after sci oly	ooh ic ic
ye u should come	is k here today?
at the junior fin lit assembly thing	kkkk
i don't think i'll be there during winblock	here's a progress report
ok	i'm not sure what we're going to do for the mid black lineup
inconsistent in which way	i also fiddled with the teeth a bit but i have seen it actually effect much
uh	maybe the arm doesn't have enough time to settle into position before it drives forward
ok sweet	there's been an interesting push for hri recently i noticed
wdym?	nah i just noticed there's been more news and papers on it
i just got fucked in the aas	where you at
physics	i'm in the hall
i got fisted a 2nd time	🐱
r u still skateboarding	yeee
i'm technically in e club rn	you wanna be cool nerd?
where r u rn?	almost st the school
do u need me to open a door	i'm behind you
oh i'm in the botball room	bruh lol
smart choices	not many places will let you go make a legged robot and then your own business lol
that's a preview of what you'll get there	unlimited resources
finally ur dream of eating resources without being accountable for them	jk jk
also when did u decide on camille? :o	iman's been bringing it up for a while
oh camille already knows?	and then i said i was joking and she said something along the lines of come onnnn
that direct approach	holy shit, da heck bruh lol
nah i was fucked up already	i was also kind of hesitant since i thought that kelvin and jason liked her or something so i didn't want to like make anything awkward
but if ur just asking her to prom it's no biggie	yeh that was my concluding thought to it
uh end of may i think	oh after we get out of school?
no actually may 12th	maybe you can get the opposite of arctic monkey's no. 1 party anthem
jk	don't do that lol
ooh actually ya	i bet that'll be nice
lol aadhya is the farthest from the slow dance type	that's a real good point
lol ew	can you forge me a pass lol
ya sure lol	wait jk k is back
i'm at botball now	stairs are going to kill me
oh what	i got a call from the fellowship while i was working out and unfortunately it was kind of loud
damnnn son	so i heard, are you still free for the 10 weeks? and there will be more info coming by mail and a banquet?
whats the company?	should i call again?
or they just called u lol	both
hmmm	i think i'm going to call again
ok	oh shit it's confirmed
but which is the one your interning for	she didn't say which place, apparently the places that are interested will contact me separately
wait so is the internship confirmed or just the banquet?	lol and here i thought it would go like college admissions and everyone will reject me since i keep talking about robot shit
thats holding the banquet	afcea
🐱	looks like i'm officially walking the path of the "dark" side
they probably have plenty of parts to steal	really? how big are they? i didn't do that much of a background check
seems like they're pretty big and have lots of history with government and military	wow
did they say when the banquet is?	lol that would be funny
it looks like the event will probably be the afcea gala on may 5th	lol you're fast at googling
even if ur joining the d a r k s i d e	🐱
lol	you at the school rn?
but i'm not working on chad rn	aight i suppose i can drop by
what talk	https://events.attend.com/f/1383784152#/reg/0/
daniella rus was our opening speaker for the first mahacks	wait really lol
well idk what it's about	there isn't much info about it besides its title
but it's at 4:30, not sure if i can get out of track that early	you can say you have a doctor appointment ;)
i think i've already made that excuse	maybe say you're feeling sick?
i've also already done that one lol	apparently my folks met yours in san diego and talked about college essays
what	what is the time frame for track
how	idk my pops just walked to me and told me that
*werent	oh wait
lol ok	jeffery is my cousin
ahh	he's our age, and is in jhu
hmmm so the events in northeastern?	yup yup
more like family thing came up out of the blu	oooh ic ic
fribo	nah dude it's not an assistant
it would be nice to have this for ashley in chicago	wanna make one for her?
i'm wondering how many "living noises" it can recognize	idk
this guy is my cpw host: http://joelgustafson.com/	things were cool until
so that's where i'll be staying	holy shit you're going to be joining a frat that early?
mit predicted my intentions	maybe that individuality mindset is why i don't like the idea of robots of just being tools
doesn't mean ppl will lose individuality	the moment that everyone starts thinking more similar to one another, would that not be the start of the hive and the end of the individual
they all agree on things that are objectively false	that's true, but the idea that a hive mind will only have one way of looking at things is still rather concerning
biggest concern is the susceptibility to attacks. if the collective network of information that everyone uses is compromised than that is really scary	isn't that an ideal version of the internet?
ya, i think it will be an evolution of the internet	but google's control over the information could also be concerning due to the fact that they can and do choose what links and info that ppl see/first 
thanks :'(	not a criticism and more of a question
intell	(i wouldn't count bd since they never actually made a product, from their inception to almost now, they are more of a military contractor than anythin
how do u define mit tech startup?	"intel was founded in mountain view, california in 1968 by gordon e. moore (of "moore's law" fame), a chemist, and robert noyce, a physicist and co-in
there are a bunch of companies whos founders were grads of mit	lol wat
but mit didn't have like a dedicated entrepreneurial program for incubating startups until like later	if we are talking about the grads of ppl making companies then apple would be a berkeley/reed startup lol
buzzfeed	buzzfeed?!
khan academy	idk if you wanna be tied to that name
who became full companies	very little
zuckerberg had to make it at harvard cuz he was still a student	the original database was taken from harvard and it was used there before spreading
how many startups do you know in general	i can name you a shit ton of robot startups lol
nation with a very few very flashy startups who got their own movies. 99.999% of startups no one would have heard about even if they're very succesful	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojtfocnguoe&index=79&list=pljvzmmbpmgnyqm9snyluwqgekxnt8kjwx
ya but i mean like high profile startups	and they also had lots of internal drama that easily lent itself to a story lol
no one hears about those companies even if they make a huge impact	that brings up an old question i think i asked you once
inventing concrete back then is like inventin carbon nanotubes now	(btw that article was an interesting read, but the proposal at the end would imply that society itself would have to change up how they treat gender n
like elon musk	this joel guy is quite the intellectual memer lolhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/dzy9z7zx4aexuh6.jpg
but i mean in that cast woz didn't actually make the pc	yeh exactly
nope i never took anything back to my house	welp shiz
i don't really want anything	once i get my first paycheck i'll get ya an e-board perhaps
i didn't really get u anything except cold ones	a shit ton of cold ones then?
it's fine tho i don't really need anything	how about
my mom wanted me to put all my accion money in there	some people wisely save their money for the future
there's something about how it only makes sense for long term	you think i'mma live _that_ long??
also i'm at the mall and i'm so lost	why are you at the mall lol
it would have to be at least after 3 and idk when i will be able to slip out	you can say you have a dentist appointment perhaps
lol so he might get really pissed	perhaps you can be like "college stuff"
but i won't lol	if you don't mind (idk if you are able to go or not)
it was fun just got back	wowow
i tried on new clothes but it feels wierd to put on clothes not from costco	holy fuck
it was more of a friend date	what is that supposed to mean
ya i'm heading back	🐱
?	the company i'm at this summer
oooh	he was an employee, got contracted on the nsa project
do u k what ur gonna be doing there	nope no idea
thanksss	we'll go grab some cold ones and meme and or talk ;)
sounds good	i'm almost done with the chad log
yo uh do u have track pants i could borrow lol	yeh but where are you
i just got back from field trip	when does the train leave?
2:43	otherwise we can switch pants lol
do u have class rn?	i'm in math
i'm in a study for the rest of break	would you be up for that?
ya lol i'm fine with switching pants if u are	wait my pants aren't the best for track either i just realized lol
but if u have time to get pants, or if you trust me to stop by your house to grab them	my house is locked lol
oh welp	i think i can skate there and get back
if u trust me with a key i can also run back and get it	if this kind of stuff happens next year i'm not going to fly back lol
lol it's ok there'll be extra pants in my frat	bye
🐱	btw
rn	extra pants that the girls left behind from the party?
🐱	yeh i'll just be skating as fast as i can lol
cuz we are just so close of friends she feels comfortable taking off her pants while we have a friendly discussion	lol
thanks for the pants in advance	are you on the street?
ok i'm there	the street?
i'll just walk toward ur house	holy crap i thought the outbound was mine lol
lmaooo	i'm lost already
oh lmao	the organizers and rus are here now lol
perfect networking time	they're having a convo separately
u should still go up and introduce yourself	i'll wait until they finish their convo or there's a good point to talk
? how	oh wait not turned down
trust me this is the best time while barely anyone is there	crap there are so many ppl around her now
r they all trying to talk to her?	yeh lol
welp	there's like 5 ppl around her now
that will get her attention	what if i get rejected
lmaoo	hmmm
really? why	the moment i did their tone and discussion immediately dumbed down a bit
there are scanner apps on ur phone	oh smart
🐱	tru
fuck you	did ya finish the webassign?
sshit	here you go
aw shit there are 3 of them	number 5 isk = 23/48 mr^2 w^2, but w being the little omega
im gonna just email carlson asking for an extension	yeh lol, it's a grind
lol wut	ppl are harassing robots
oh have i told you how i might be kidnapped at cpw	wat
and sit down quietly in a circleit has to be exactly 10.wear close toed shoes and don't be under any influencetell me the next day how it goes"	don't do drugs dude
i'm gonna get kdinapped ol	where does buzz find this legendary level of memeage lol
that technician	"these gloves are not good for this purpose"
there are some hardcore frat parties on saturday night lol	wait are you serious
ofc dude	aight
https://cpw2018.mit.edu/meetings?query=party&&classes[]=groups%3a%3ameetings%3a%3ameeting	i mean there are 2 worst case scenarios
does osu have frats?	idk actually
🐱	🐱
i'll check them out	zeta psi huh?
isn't it godfather	reservoir dogs
ah ok	or maybe it's goodfellas by martin scorsese
there's a godfather painting on the door	lol nah man godfather only had a handful gun shoot out scenes, it was always more political action that lead up to a big kill rather than just action 
tho he did say they're frat is more quirky than most	idk why i keep assuming i know frats, all i've seen are buzz's alcohol ridden buildings
so no hardcore parties	so i shouldn't come visit on saturday?
🐱	that's a tad disappointing
ya it's a nice frat	ahh ic ic
about to go see atlas	i've never seen a baxter with a different base before
my tour guide is from the leg lab lol	holy shit what
he's a sophomore so he did an urop	they're like the hallmark of a nice robotics lab lol
🐱	skating makes you more tired than i first thought
oh shit forgot abour that	it's so nice today
slayin girls left and right	i don't think i'm doing that
because u slayin them too hard	also this book proposes that the control theory behind a single leg can apply to any number of legs with the addition of a bookkeeping system to recor
that's today at 10	yooo
i might stop by one of the ragers later	the 10 thing is supposed to be a rager?
idk it sounds like it	did alexandria tell you what it was in the end?
"unleash your inner panther with the bros of nu delta"	who knows dude, maybe cheetah guy will come and punch you in the face during it
it went until 4:30 am	"inner panther"well a panther is a type of cat
it was sicc tho	tangerine?
we also sat on top of the big dome	oh wow, so you got to see all the insides and out?
i mean no one checks so u could totally come	lol, aight whenever i get the chance to visit let's throw robots off of the dome
how come?	rwdc, which also leads me to have to get a "suit" and family friends are coming for some reason
is it just practicing presentations?	there's a lot to present
wait what do you need to catch up on?	i don't even understand some of the equations so far and how he derived them
well thats normal	normal isn't the goal though
i cant come today	wipe that smirk off your douche face
ok thanks!	there's so many new problems
ya sure uh how about like 8	sounds good
🐱	no ones here lol
at least good enough to go to a mun meeting at 5:30 today. i'll probably come to botball afterwards	i heard the mun meeting takes like three hours lol
ya i don't think it will tho	we've just had our biggest failed run
ouch	🐱
wait whats happening to chad	i'm going to kill myself
🐱	wait
but jen isnt going to the mun meeting	ohhh
ya she would murder me if she heard that	meet any ellies at mit?
lol no	wat
shes a prefrosh. im gonna see her again at visitas	lol
we said we would meet up at visitas	boiii
🐱	🐱
and on the first day i bump into her as one of the first people i met	destiny?
but we dont k eachother well enough	i'll be your wingman
^link^	wow her last name is almost yours
she also loves going to hackathons	this is too good man
what r u doing in boston?	ros meet
sicc	if you wanna come you should sign up asap
i think ill pass for this one	whoa
woah	should i submit this as a big?
i mean u could if u wabt	i'll fucking due the shit out of zuck
🐱	now you just have a red mark lol
but turns out shes not goung shopping	oh
i dont like her in that way	just really close friends?
*close	so who would be a really close friend then lol
ya	🐱
i have no good reason to be awake	are ya just chatting with ppl or something
ya lol	go get em tiger
mainly girls lol	lol
:'(	are you just feeling lonely and stufd
nah nit reallt ae just got in a conversation and it went to girls	here's some not super edgy but kinda along your style of songs
when ru getting here?	shit
the image is really creepy lol	geezus dude what are you doing up so late
for winmun	ooh gam i i
wbu	gambino
lol	this was the song from the beginning of get out
i heard of it bc there was an acappella group at mit that performed this	it's probably cuz i heard it so much already lol
tho also not really my type of music	ahh ic ic
psh im fineeee	are you just thinking more about the future since high schools essentially done?
i just don't feel tired yet	that could be all the sugar from yesterday coursing through your veins lol
oh wut	ikr didn't expect that
lol he's salty	chad can pick up botguy?
lol only 70% meming	...
btw r u doing senior assassin?	it's not mandatory?
lol they're not gonna make shooting ppl with water guns mandatory	maybe i'll do it
but ya it would be super easy to get u ngl	what happens after you get your target though
the target is out, and you get your target's target	ooohhh
$20 from ethan	are you serious
well just don't bring electronics everywhere	🐱
🐱	you're doing it?
ya	i honestly probably won't know who my target is
hey i found harvard's robot	holy fuck only ten
how's rwdc?	we finished
🐱	she's 20
damn	she also got rejected from every college she applied to
she a cougar?	even after working at the robotics institute, northman gunthrop
aww that's really cool	her opening line during the alumni talk was like
damn	just woke up completely
its spicy	max and david msg'd me today apparently
no you're not	🐱
who do u have?	what advantage would i gain if i told you
that's what i'm doing with most of my friends	who knows though
i have caroline conway	lmaoo dude you're going to try to peg one of the nicest and upstanding ppl in the school?
ya lol	idk how i would get her though lol
hmm	oh wait nvm
well i think its eaiser bc shes someone u k	friday i have cyber cafe
nicee	is senior skip day on may 1st?
actually id	eh that's something to worry about later
lol oh no why did u ask her	just to confirm
u shouldve asked mark	fuk tru
but i think she suspects you now	nah she basically knows now lol
🐱	welp oops
well then nothing will happen until someone gets you out	i'm usually in the school or at home lol
lol but ur so close to the school	yeh that's tru
is the girl a pothead	she lives in cali now
is she from texas	pennsylvania
tho carlson extended the webassigns to the wrong date so i don't have to do them tonight	🐱
is that the ones due tonight	there's also one due tomorrow and i think friday or monday
shit	don't forget to talk to haver today too
ya lol i already made a bs  progress log	ayyyy
ya amazon is trying to break into every market lol	feels like they're trying to be a more ambitious google
its just less of a media-grabbing company than spacex	really?? i thought that it wasn't able to actually reach space space
ya they can't yet	is it really that good of a business plan to stretch your resources into so many r&d projects that aren't necessarily connected?
it's just owned by jeff bezos	is he just trying really hard to be as popular as musk then lol
nah blue origin is older than spacex	then what's his goal with it?
musk just did it better in less time lol	🐱
oh apparnetly it's first goal was a suborbital space vehicle	wat
probably in response to spacex	poor bezos, the media just kind of glosses him over a bit with musky around
ya	do you have track today?
who killed u?	kate ryan
confirmed	who da fuk is shane lol
lol he's in our grade	i mean it is called senior assass
i heard they snuck into ur house	lol kind of
they're too used to random ppl going to ur house	feels bad
wdym	in an email they were talking about how i can be a part of the acquisition of contracts, management, and consulting processes
ya i'm coming down now	got an eta?
holy shit this just happened	holy shit
so he has fcharlie	ahhh
and there are 3 passengers in the back	hmmm
jeremy can	aight
i'll do it	sounds good i'll just be packing up the rest
oh iman is gonna come over at some pt and pick up stuff as well	you know the wheeled and four legged robots that were in the darpa robotics challenge?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0tayhjpofo	every human on this earth has fallen before
legs are creepy af	that's only if they're uncanny
that's still pretty creepy	the wifi is so crappy it didn't load for me yet
🐱	i wanna meet someone who can identify robots on the spot and then we can have a robo id off
only for robotic legs	it's not a fetish
and furrys have an extreme passion for humanoid animals	no that's different
wdym more than our will	we can't really just say i like being with this group of people and so i'll live here
its just up to if you prioritize ppl over other factors	but what if the other factors are our hopes and dreams
🐱	i woke up not too long ago lmao
u shouldn't skip and come with us	nah i still promised tomorrow
u can skip both tho lol	that's a lotta skipping lol
it's senior yearrrr enjoy it	nah i just don't want an n lol
spend more time with the boiiis	i gotta manage my time mannn
 you called foxy roxy.	wait a sec idk how long i can do stuff tonight
also are u down to play board games after school	i haven't seen her
:d	congrats!!!
we watched there will be blood	duuudeee
i have to do something for winblock but sarah said you guys are leaving afterwards	yeh prets much
what's the work thing?	holy shit the connections came full circle
lol	hmmm i hope i didn't seem douchey
are u considering it if it's the same price as osu?	it's definitely not the same price lol
especially u already got a big hookup from hurst	so you're saying the connection possibility at nu is better?
most of ur connections and field experience will all be linked to legged robots and agility as well	what would i explore at nu that osu doesn't have though
cuz i'm assuming there aren't a lot of other robotics stuff at osu	nah osu is the steward for ros
like other types of engineering, or just other ya k --more viable-- fields	i thought that first
🐱	but that wouldn't make any sense
no i'm saying u can't necessarily garuntee you'll keep that connection if ur in oregon	are friendly email updates not enough lol
lol well it's not the same at least	yeh the connections here are a lot better and diverse
 you've already made connections with hurst and you have such a specific interest, you would definitely get more opportunities in legged robots at osu	you saying that i'm not good enough of a roboticist to stand out in nu?
i'm saying u look like every other asian aadhya points at	i have crazier hair
bc there are more ppl pursuing the same thing as you	is it because there are a lot more general "i like robots" ppl at nu but if you're at osu then it's kinda already a given that you would be hardcore c
opposite at nu	that's a good point
if ur certain, than the connections at osu are also better than nu	bruh you should know how certain i am
think of all the ppl hurst can hook u up with	if buzz says yes we might have this convo again just warning ya lol sorry
lol np	that's the scary part though a lot of this is banking on hurst and his team
well think of how many freshmen he meets who are into legged robots	yeh good point
lol zame	who would've thunk that the school known for its oceanography and forestry environmental shiz
and ros	yeh right lol
stay safe!	i can't find the terminal
?	it's rather empty here
the what	wait oops
u better meming me rn	i am not
ru ok?	nah
ah ok	ok now i'm memory
oh gawd	oh there's more people now
🐱	hmmm
at echo?	yeh
damn they're like the main sponsor	what the heck lol
damn u seem to be pretty heated about that lol	was i? did i?
ray rays	what do you think are the chances that i could hitch hike to the free parts place on june 5?
hitchhiking is not a thing in suburban massachusetts lol	damnit
same thing	luckily it's not a crowdsourced machine learning taxi service
🐱	sarah where u at
not sure if i can make the study session	🐱
she yells at me anyways :(	she said vines
also i need to be home by 11:30 so i would only stay there for like 30 min lol	you have a curfew?
well it's a loose curfew but my parents want me home theb	i never knew lol
🐱	are you actually going to climb vo rn
maybe we can get in on it	well there are some stories of people coming up with great algorithms and designs while high off their asses
i don't think there's a big difference	cuz the end result is the same?
rip	that's insane lol
for colleges of the same size and caliber	is it really worth it though
lol	which school is worth that much debt
if you calculate the average increase that college adds to your paycheck, you indirectly pay for college in about 5 - 10 years	you know i don't care about pay
the reason ppl stay in student debt for longer than that is bc they use up their earnings to improve their life quality	i just care about what kind of shit i can get, from connections to parts to teams
lol	but i don't think those are worth 70k unless marc raibert is your fucking personal mentor
🐱	srs though
lol	is it really that amazing of a school
but i think you're taking it too much at face value	but i'm a one sided guy who doesn't believe in stanford robotics since it's like bleh ever since ros dudes generation lefg
and also if you want to talk cost effective, robotics is probably not the best field to look at	i think that's only applicable to ppl who don't have a very specific field they know they want to enter
maybe it isn't worth for robotics	lol we just reached the same point pretty quickly
i just don't know enough about stanfrod robotics to make a full opinoin	i would say the robotics institute might might be worth but it's a graduate school and costs like 40k instead
but 60k - 70k is nothing if you take advantage of the opportunities at the college	the psychology majors at stanford are not going to be able to make that back
and ofc they will be able to make it back	hmmm i don't know enough data of how much stanford ba ppl make after graduating undergrad
it's a $82,000 starting salary	but what field though
it doens't list by field, just by degree	all the generalizations of money ultimately mean nothing if it doesn't hold a true average among individuals
average psychology majors with a bachelor's degree started out at a median of $35,700	🐱
so even tho we don't know stanford's psych major starting salary i'm betting it's above $35,700 if they're getting an average of 82,000	above 35k can still mean like 45k lol
art history is probably like 45k	ok if we meet a super successful and amazing person who paid full price at stanford i'll rescind my previous statement
there are a ton of super succesffuly stanford students	but as long as that fucking paper skull robot shit video exists i don't believe in stanford
since its such a minor part of the school	minor
lol	jk
not that its a bad thing, but also i don't think you should measure everything by their proficiency in robotics	you just watch me @_@
🐱	yeh but oregon is made out of weed
damnnn you're getting the best deal on your weed	lol
but i don't imagine i'll do it a lot	*flash forward five years*
i might pull a gabe	that would be insane
i'll manufacture the leaves you send me in the basements of mit into finished products	leaves delivered by legged robots
🐱	if control theory of robots eventually reach the point of where they need ai (which i predict they will once they get the foundations of locomotion do
i can see the argument for nu	what was the argument for nu again?
ya better connections, better city, wider range of options	wait, what do you mean by options
of fields of study and research	you mean majors not relating to robotics?
🐱	pshh
the old botball captain	oh shit i read that as that she went to high school with matt li and so i was about to question how old you really are
apparently matt li graduated cornell already in 3.5 years, with both a bachelors and a masters degree	wait shit what
i mean they're consistent and the robots are kinda flashy	are they really that "consistent" doe
and they keep having new robots every few months for inexplicable reasons	i refute that adjective, tis not inexplicable, the answer is simple, they somehow got money so they make robots
🐱	i gotta say
but the 3d tour	🐱
lmao	i'm literally banking everything on the robotics lab going in, i see what you mean by its good to be able to branch out lol
you could've scouted out good places to board	problem is what would i branch out to
u beat me	lmaoo, that's pretty funny that we can do that
bad in what way?	his reasoning for it was things such as hacking will become more prevalent and dangerous as tech becomes more integrated into society. the advancement
but even if the gap increases, everyone's standard of living collectively rises	but isn't "equality" of standard of living also based on perspective
🐱	hmmm even if the wage gap is huge
rip i just realized i have to take the ap latin late exam on the 24th so i will have to leave at like 11 am from the robotics conference	bruh
this was like in march when i turned in my ap form	wait so you skipped that so that you would have to come back to school for one day days later to take latin?
i dont really want to miss the countdown	not gonna lie, i do not understand that
and also i assume we're gonna be doing something on the last day of school	then again i thought that the concept of echo is a waste of time to myself (not saying that it is for everyone else, but to me)
🐱	idk why, but i've been thinking about robots non-stop for a while now
i thought it was fine	wait wut
as long as the object goes in a straight line, i'm ok	bruh
:'(	i'm stuck on 2b rn, but i just realized i didn't convert the fuking units to metric
well u don't convert to metric, just convert to feet per second	it's an itch that i must satisfy, must convert
roy this is why we're single	motherfuking answer is in ft
lol	did you get around 9 ft?
i got 8.889	lmao fuk i'm on my last try
just to check	yeh sure
s = car max speedca = car accel1. bike distance = 0.5(ba)(bs/ba)^2+bs(bs/ca - bs/ba)2. car distance = 0.5(ca)(bs/ca)^2max distance = (1.) - (2.)	lmao i got 13 feet
yup	so for velocity it was ft/s and accel it's ft/s^2
yup	fuk it really is 13 ft??
what are your numbers	nah it's correct lol
lol thanks	this is another indication perhaps as to why we don't have gf
🐱	holy crap i forgot an article at the end of my previous message
wow you filthy foreigner	you're not wrong
i didn't know you came from a 3rd world country	damn
i don't think thats normal	lol i searched it up and google returned stuff about anxiety and panic attacks and desensitization
and get your entire body checked out	psh
idk if lack of exercise would do it tho	maybe it's due to depression
🐱	https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018
i was waiting u til i finished reading the thong u sent so i could properly respond	bruh it's fine lol
thanks lol	i got'chu bro
🐱	i gotta say though
are you actually tryng to?	i should try to be more "sociable"
also nice job at shakespeare day	thanks man
i'm coming again d block	i'm going to lose my voice
also i'm gonna be in china on june 14th	june 14th to when?
june 10th to 17th	oh that's good
oh for botball	yeh my voice is done for lol
woah what	yeah i thought you'd like to know about that
that's basically apps for robots right?	yeh essentially
cuz even phone apps are having  trouble with all the different hardware cinfigs of phones these days	yeh the internals would have to very standardized like a what kota's company is making
except for robots instead of toys	can you imagine that lol
or dinosaurs	tru
 foxy roxy missed your call.	yes i'm still home
feel better!	did you guys come over just to drop these off?
ya but we were already downtown so	ahh
it's so easy to get into ur house	when i live by myself i'm going to have insane security measures
lol in ur tin hut?	yes
is already way more secure than what u have now	maybe also a camera
they actually sell a lot of those	what really
also u sure ur ok?	i just wonder if that's an actual viable strategy for a business
i mean bd is still alilve somehow	they haven't actually sold anything lol
the prom was pretty lame, we ditched early and grabbed food with her friends, then went back to her house and played cards lol	shiz
ours will be way better	ohhh
there's like a different thing each day of this week	da fuk
lol the bike ride from my house is like 30 min	you live so far away
i eat what's in my fridge	i mean real food
and if that runs out i eat the plants in the yard	lol
see when ur family's vegetarian u don't need a lawnmower	i feel like that's a line you've used multiple times in the past
wow nicee	this is before i get told to fuk off and that my idea is bad and i should feel bad
was this at the daniella rus event	yeh
you seem bitter	just a bit salty
ya i think the legged robotics community is probably pretty small and connected	can't tell if that's a good thing or not :,)
that's what college is for i guess	lol you'll become an expert in legged locomotion by sheer osmosis by being friends with me
not ai related	da heck is multi-sided platforms
its any type of business who's product is the reduction of friction in interaction between two parties	are you becoming a business man
so uber, airbnb, facebook	🐱
its a relatively new categorization bc they're becoming more prevalent now	oh wait i didn't even realize that categorization existed, that's actually pretty cool
ya but not for that reason	facebook reduces your privacy, that makes sense
for example, wikipedia is also for obtaining data but its not a multi-sided platform	it's not?
no bc both sides have to be customers of that platform	like the bois provide the normies the genesis and wiki makes it easier to get the text of the genesis
lmao	but what significance does this categorization provide besides just being a thing ppl noticed
theres a lot of different approachs you take that would be considered crazy with traditional economics	sounds like communism idk how i feel about commie ideals seeping into my capitalism
wait that's not like communism at all	giving money to people is communism
until we become like a true spacefaring society where there's a need to regularly go to space	ima red blooded republican, i don't need to know how social governmental systems work i just need to be stubbornly radical on one side
i think especially spacex is really smart	really? despite all its financial close calls
think of how much nasa burns through on space r&d. i think how he made spacex was super brilliant and its kinda an entrepreneurial miracle	i argue that a realistic sex robot company would be harder
true, i also forgot legged robots	what parts were brilliant though? i'm assuming you don't mean his self funding
also is it worth studying for physics at this pt	lmao no
and he knows how each part of the rockets work	be careful dude the moment you get hands on with your staff like the receptionist you might be called out for a scandal
lol	but how much does he know though
i think musk is cool bc he is an engineer before he's a businessman	really? doesn't that make jobs and zucker exceptions to that
jobs?	oops
it has to say helloooo	well gates technically "stole"
very rarely do the founders actually act as ceos	oh tru, it's not like musk made the rocket himself lol, that would be stupidly insane
i mean it makes sense for the comapny bc usually the founders of tech companies suck at business	yeh but you gotta keep the vision of the product in mind
in industry, most of the time the highest an mit person gets in a company is the cto position, a lot of it bc of mit culture frowning upon business	if that was your only goal it might've been easier to become a cto from harvard
the ceo appoints the cto lol	maybe i'm biased but i would think they're on the same level of importance in the tech world
i mean	with a more specific focus
the world is not the tech world	what
ard told me "if you want to build the ship you go to mit, if you want to run the ship u go to harvard" and i was like nahhh fuck you i'm gonna do both	lol who said that ship quote
and works with harvard faculty as well	well shiz they just laid it thick on ya lol
i haven't checked	i think it might've been sent to me by mistake since i am not a vip lol
isn't that the day of the robotics conference?	nah day before
do u k what's happening there tho?	nope
*pre-event	time for me to flex my huge cfo muscles and skills
you'll miss the 2nd half of the marathon	you know what would solve this problem
a *wheeled* sheldon bot	is that a big bang reference?
just checked	whew
it might be like for everyone	so it's 100% ok to accept
you won't miss any movies	ayyyy
that's the time when well be eating dinner	perfect timing
nice	getting to massrobotics is a fucking hassle though lol
where is it?	gotta go through the bus and train and shit
that's like everywhere in boston lol	yeh but the bus?!
idk if i feel safe with u alone on the bus	lmao
at least u have a phone now	i'll just use my longboard
 	it's just french for appetizers?! fuk, i thought it was a dish this whole time
wearable tech :d	hmmm
but only music for robots	exactly
? for booz allen?	yes
it's about 44k	wait really
in a yr	lmao
it'll be ok, maybe eating a hors d'oeuvres will make u feel better	yeh that's my favorite dish
unless it has like a programmed burnout every morning after x amount of sunlight	exactly
🐱	 you missed a call from foxy roxy.
/ r u ok	it's bigger than i thought
bruhhh lol	nah i'm probs not going to awards lol
this is why legs are unviable	well maybe if i just show up bloody
🐱	that would be quite the physics problem
ya sure	do you have an eta for when you'll be at my house?
is she driving me to ur house?	yeh we're in the same car
or to echo	we need to be at the highschool for emily to pick us up
emily lee	nah ten
farzana	9999999
they're picking me and emily up from 99	what
iman and lulu are picking u up	whaaa
i'll send vids	here ya go from tonight
i feel like i wanna be wasted a least once just to see what drunk me is like	feel like you might get sad
and edgy	really? bitchy??
lol idk bc when i get tired i start roasting ppl	really?
lol maybe	where you at man
i'm probably going to school soon	aight come by e block so we can grab our yearbooks
where did everyone go?	i'm in math with some ppl rn
oh u actually went to class	yeh i did
lmao	i think you might appreciate this
roy why u sending me ur scabs	to gross you out
i don't nee.d that. imagery	you're welcome
btw r u going to enka?	shiz what
ya it is	think imma head home
lmao did u get that book?	lmao i wish
of art historians	so like 7 bucks?
🐱	aight back to reading about the most interesting field around
wow i didn't k u liked computational linguistics	no i'm into computational art history
woops that was mean	holy crap
🐱	i'm guessing you can't come tonight?
whats lame about that	that's kinda lame bruh
ok well captain america's super power is he can throw shields harder so	how is it funny doe i thought he was like a depressed and divorced single father
but its still funny	yeh but captain america is buff af
and he's funny	his power is to be small or big lol
if u inject the pym particle into things it reduces the space between atoms	that's not how atoms work!!
ignore a bunch of other physics shit and boom	you can't reduce the shell spaces
🐱	ok that's true lol
or shoot lasers	yeh he's not black
actually ya black panther can jump like 20 ft	holy shit what
there was a scene in black panther where he jumped up onto an jet taking off and destroyed it	wat
ok	shit
i've been mathxling through julia's party	lol
whenever ppl leave	should i still go?
i might drop by once i finish mathxl	wanna show up as the late kool kids
"fashionably late"	do you have a ride there afterwards?
oh first i need to go buy food for the marathon	do you mind if i hitch on? i don't want to walk anymore since my knee is leaking
damn r u sure u don't wanna stay home	oh yeh i still need to get you your cold ones
and ya sure u can get a ride	thanksss
it's due tuesday	lol
i'll probably need an extra set of hands to load shit into the car	yeh sure
i'm leaving now so i'll be there in about 15	nice i just took a phat showa
u coming?	just woke up
ru coming?	leg day
yes we all hate u roy	it's a fuking feast here
damn	grilled chicken sticks everywhere
so i have some tickets ordered but not yours i don't think	aight
do u want me to order ur ticket?	yeh sure
i probably will be too	aight cya in several hours
also the more i think about it the more thanos is right	there's a reason he's the bad guy lol
well i think that's why he's the most interesting villain	whatcha talking about ultron was clearly the best villain
you have to look past the boxes of villain vs hero and see which side actually makes sense	🐱
he's just as super hardline utilitarian	i think this quote sums up my stance on it and why i don't like thanos side
🐱	not cuz he's a villain but more so that i don't think ppl have the right to equate lives to just numbers
according your duty it would be incorrect to kill 5 ppl	if there are 5 ppl right there who needs immediate help than those 1000 who might need help
the deontologist approach is that no matter what, killing is wrong	yeh that would just be a lose lose situation for a deontologist
that's what utilitarianism is all about	but not everything is a trolley problem where this or that does
in the long run u maximize happiness	his plan didn't have to be that though
right i'm not saying thanos' plan is necessary the ultimate best one, but it would ultimately still create a net benefit in the universe	cuz rn it's weighing which is more important ultimate happiness or ppl living
true, i would argue that 1 million happy ppl is better than 2 million miserable ppl	🐱
we can continue the discussion tomorrow cuz i gotta sleep	when you can cherry pick the results then yeh one is going to seem better than the other
but ultimately i think thanos is really cool villain	but in practice it's too complicated for that
to make a judgement	lol yeh you should sleep first
ok gonna sleep now cya in 4 hrs	good night man
have you left your house yet?	almost
like the showcase	not sure about that
ya i'll probably come a little before then	alright
ok actually ill just take some caffeine pills and leave now with u	lol
but i think i'll be fine	alright so i will come pick you up
what's ur eta?	need to drop my sister off
ok. i'll set an alarm for 10 lol	that's not 10 o clock right lol
lol ni	there's slight morning traffic rn
ok how long should snooze for	five
r u outside?	almost
that would be so funny in this room	more nerds and way less suits right here
they're talking about what fields are currently most aggressively automating	like art history?
this is the one and only time where an art historian might be useful	pay day for them lol
it has over a 10 interlocking timelines of the same 3 characters	sounds perfectttt
lol	holy shit dude
wow roy u perv	i did not mean to do that
bruh	i feel kinda guilty
lol don't feel guilty it's all good	holy fuck
how is day 2?	fucking great shit
tho there aren't enough uses for having powerd clothes yet for that to be useful	or underwear that can turn your piss into energy and water
genius	you think i may be kidding but you know how useful that could be for long distance travelers?
how would it turn your piss into energy	piss is hot as shit man
and you could just bring a water filtration device	or
you would probably need extra mass to carry awater filter in your pants	but your pants are the water filter
google science fair	yeh
or just running	sam and i sprinted for 30 seconds over and over again
usually i have to force myself to try to do small talk, it doesn't come naturlaly	oh don't worry dude
and if u send a safety message first	safety messages are sacred
whereas some ppl can just keep talking forever about random shit naturally	yeh
i'm thinking of getting a ymca membership cuz i just discovered the woburn y is only like 1.8 miles from my house	well ppl like it when others express their passion for something usually (unless you're like trying to constantly flex like an ahole)
so i can actually not be fat over the summer	you should def do that
aadhya got mad at me cuz she thought i only talked to her when it was about prom	lol
in reality i'm just not on messenger that much	i mean to be fair to you it's prom soon so
ya, well i think some ppl are sensitive to that kind of thing	yeh ppl are surprisingly sensitive to social media
and she complained to me bc she said that person was throwing shade at her	lol
ya basically	i feel like we will never not continue meeting people who sometimes act like that
or commenting but not liking	lmaooo
so i guess that's why, and that ppl can look at the big fat number of likes	what is that emotional payoff though?
ya	i wonder if it would be worth to learn and fully understand such little social media intricities?
i think engineer / stem ppl sometimes underestimate the importance of it	perhaps stuff for getting your name and creations out there would be useful but that would be more of a viral video than something else
that's why robotics companies suck at marketing	*not perhaps
thats just posting a video	what exactly is marketing
ally cares about presentation or these small social things. so i would definitly fit into mit better, but i wouldn't develop or improve in that aspect	cuz i know examples of marketing failing like when tony the tiger started to get cat called and sexually harassed by furries
lmao	oops we were thinking of drastically different thing
its like outreach and marketing and stuff	well you could develop/improve in that aspect by hanging out with harvard kids or getting a gf
lol	preferably a girl who's into that stuff, not joking about this part
🐱	aka sarah -> singular harvard person? lol
nah i'm gonna try to immerse myself in some communities at harvard	yeh i'm starting to wonder if bd and agility are so far existing solely for the fact that their tech is just top of the line
like amazon	but i would argue they're not a "tech" company
ok then apple	well now they got products like the kindle, but before they had the resources to fund such projects
w, samsung has better tech but apple has built such good brand loyalty that they are still able to convince ppl to pay way more $$ for shittier phones	but their biggest ad from the superbowl actually lost money if i'm not mistaken
i'm talking about their entire brand strategy	from my knowledge on apple (mostly articles, snippets from books, and interviews) their main strength seemed to be hitting the computer game early on 
well apple is used a lot in marketing case studies	that their ads were good?
r example focusing on the value proposition rather than the features, and having very consistent and minimalist but very identifiable branding content	so you're saying that their branding is a composition of their design philosophy and their repeated emphasis of their intentions/superiority of their 
i think for a lot of ppl their main exposure to robotics in daily life is probably with roombas	and youtube videos
🐱	but haven't you noticed
they like got rid of finals clubs at harvard last year	they did?! but justin how will harvard kids become more than just a rando jew going to lame parties to never be remembered?!
 a few explicitly collaboration clubs, but i might also join one of their business organizations and one of the speech and debate teams if mit's sucks	the connections with the peers is what matters the most though in such an environment
stance on what?	whether or not that peer thing is true
idk much about where osu is tho	it's in a forest
tho you havent been to osu right? so do u k the atmosphere there	yeh that's true
i never even considered applying there bc how far they are from cities	don't you hate how morning dumps feel so cold when you sit down
lol	you're up early
and i'm sickish	damn how you get sick like that
ya it's not like deathly illness just some minor sore throat	i would get you some chicken noodle soup but by the time i get there i'll probably also catch a cold
lmao	oh the woes of transportation
the woes of being in the middle of bumfuck nowhere	hey you got uh
lol	lmao
i feel so unproductive	but what do you have to do lol
well i'm planning on practicing piano more, working out, reading a few more books and catching up on some ai	i feel like at least personally urgency of a hard deadline that other ppl need too like when school starts really helps form an actual schedule
i've already handed off mahacks to new directors and the clubs are all done except botball	dayumnnn who are the new directors?
i'm now just on an advisory role	what do you advise them on?
while the parents take notes	lol
it'll actually be easier for me to help out	cuz you won't be in nowhere
she also just invited me onto the board of youth cities	so you saying you basically own youth cities now?
but it's not like i'm getting any shares or anything	so you can now help fire ppl if you wanted to
i'm just helping with advising the direction of the company	oust the ceo
i thought he was ceo	wasn't scully ceo at that time?
that's why he got a vote in deciding	ahh that makes more sense
it works closely with cic	what
ya	just the classification of them are like the opposite of what most companies want
they have to pass some inspections and stuff but ya they function mostly like regular companies	huh who knew
ew	they had a quote somewhere that said (i'm paraphrasing a bit)
sounds like some hippie shit	right
but theres nothing on their website	ikr
i don't think they're tryna make useful things	disney is going to break rusty squid's kneecaps if they aren't careful
🐱	they seem more of an high tech art studio with no advertisement of their previous art works lol
welll they look pretty new	from their youtube channel they've made several things
as of now	i like the concept of them but so far they've been recreating things that disney have done
i think u gotta give them some time lol they're just a startup	yeh true i guess i have the wrong expectation of startups to burst out with something fairly spectacular
you only get a facebook like one out of 10 thousand srartups	i feel like there's a lot of startups that just kinda do random small things though
ya	and i just wonder how they can survive
or until they die broke in their mom's basement	that's kinda dark
ya lol	kinda wish i knew of some case studies of that, ppl utterly failing until death
well usually ppl give up before they die	i wonder why they fail so much though
idk were talking about hypothetical ppl. it probably highly depends	and if what it's doing simply isn't that important they will die
it's like working 10 yrs on a  startup then realizing amazon did the same thing but better and faster	yeh tru i have no examples of ppl failing over and over until they just lose
lol do u mean connectu	yeh they're the same thing i believe
your also not gonna get a good representation of the startups out there by googling it	then how would one get a good rep of it
what's playground	robotics funding place
where are u going for pre-prom?	what's pre-prom
before prom	oh is that like
but u should	nvm just found out i need a special part that won't come until july
aww that sucks	oh jk amazon sold one that might come in june
lol rip	yeh i'm making one now
lol r u actuaally	yeh why not, skateboard is too dangerous to experiment with, might as well make something else
it just kinda sucks cuz it's right before prom	you should probably rest up as hard as you can rn
i better charge up my crystal therapy	lmao
i already have a bunch of crystals charged up and ready	how would they actually discharge the crystals i wonder
or u suck the energy out	i heard that the ass absorbs things much better
there's a reason we don't eat into our asses	maybe our asses absorb so well to get the last bit of nutrients from our shit
who took the time to do this lol	someone who really liked his nuts
lol ya the description is the best part	people will do anything for a good meme
saskia has a tesla	yeh duuuudeeee
damn	the fuking door handles retract into the car
elon musk is actually a design genius	did he personally design the teslas?
like retract and shit	lol
yee	would you ever do something like that
like would u actually insist to jeopardize a product showcase just so your robot says hello	yes
the only reason we have positive impressions of these examples is because they worked out in the end	don't be a wuss bruh
but if they didn't work out then you would just be a terrible ceo	nah i think if it's an integral part to the system
neither the handles or saying hello are integral parts of the system	if one is showcasing a walking robot and it doesn't do anything special like jumping in a world of places like bd then you're not going to make a dent
or smthn	oh you mean like a much more minute detail
how's the corsage lookin	doing aight
but that's probs fine	it's to show that i make the biggest and best corsages
what is it mounted on?	a shit ton of hot goue
are u sure it fits her arm?	it fits mine
lol	so i'm just guessing lol
that's what aadhyas friend used to make hers	bruh what lol
and it worked pretty well	i thought it was supposed to be a ribbon cuz idk class something
it doesnt have to be as long as u can't see it	like dicks
🐱	don't forget your propel mints in case you kiss her
should i bring my computer	dude i was just about to ask the same question
🐱	i needed to get and configure some software for motor controllers for an upcoming workshop
what that	use casanova in a sentence. noun. the definition of a casanova is a man who is passionate about women and has many lovers. an example of casanova is t
ah	wait shit
🐱	i need softer toilet paper
bruh are u still on the toilet	yes
have u gotten dressed yet at all	got socks and pants
 foxy roxy missed your call.	where you at man
rip why?	cuz the snores
bruh	?
🐱	lol what
nah she only did it cuz it's a requirement	holy shit art history can be a requirement??
and she picked that obe	wow
ya idj	still feel like i'm in a weird state where i think i need sleep but i'm still fairly functioning
cuz adrenaline	such a bad feeling
i got one	nice
i assume	apparently not
oh wait	shiz that's kinda far
bruh isn't it right in downtown	what
it's right across from the train station	fuck there's too many bugs to read outside rn
also it's at 7	oh so you can walk there in time
i'm gonna be slightly late	yeh sure
wow	btw does this cost money
i don't think so	here now
but she zoomed in on the fist	look around the fist
i'm confused	6.5/10
thanks dude	the fist was actually supposed to be about aiyadiahs arm being slack
but then i got bombarded with this shit	ok we're done now
what movie did u guys end up watching	you
oooh i really wanna watch that	sarah fell asleep lol
ya she told me lol	yeh it's my favorite ghibli movie, romance, high fantasy + steampunk-ish tech
have fun with the rest of weeb night	good night justin!!
are u going to any of the grad parties today?	given that i woke up around now
probably not	unless i actually know the person fairly close i don't see much point in going
when is treehouse club today?	no idea
rip	probably after sarah is done with her music friends stuff
ok	have you been hanging around at home?
ya basically	i feel
yup	i better run huh
ya	i slept through middle school graduation
*ass	oh no it's bright outside
wait u know this i told u	i must've forgot lol
ur always active but asleep	oops ^^"
ur a fucking bitch	are you guys still there?
ended at 5am	so you guys went home at 5am?
now it's justin	yeh i could tell lol
woah u could tell?	i'm guessing you guys are at sarah's house?
no	well justin doesn't swear like that
bitch	lol
in my car	ahhh
talkin	are ya coming for botball today?
ya i might be a bit late i just woke up	the roles have reversed
lol	a ups man just delivered a long and huge mysterious amazon box to my house
uh	yeh same
how is it going?	im googling so much stuff rn
or a conference	seems more like a lecture seminar with a demo
ok i'll check it out	they also use buzz words
machine learning	description from robohub on that company
nope	how you gonna get to the meeting for sci oly today then? :oo
*soon	hey
lol	you hate me
why do u keep saying thattr	🐱
lol	lol sarah worries about you not liking her for some reason
shit	it's alright man
nope	really??
writing essays and such	what the
and then for the freshman pre-orientation programs, gotta write essays to get in to some of the better programs	wtf lol
ru at botball?	well it's locked rn
it would be so much easier to do anything	you should learn how to drive soon lol
ya..	https://i.redd.it/yeye5ye3ll211.png
i really hope its real	i doubt it lol
the lawyers would flip their shit	fuking lawyers ruining everything
cuz its a null? or smthn	fuk if i know why js does that
welp dude i fucked up	what happened?
its ok im getting advice from sarah now	sounds like she had a bad day in general so that's probably why she got mad
tho according to nina she flipped out at her when nina accidently spelled it wrong too	ahhh sarah explained it
ya i think so	ahh that's good to hear
idk how i'm gonna get there tho	want me to skate to your house in the morning and then we can bike/skate?
well i'll be hitting the gym in the morning	wait
morning around 9 or 10	unless you don't want us to be around lol
when do u usually go?	when i'm awake
i always go in the mornings right when i wake up	wow
"always" = the past 3 days lol	well, 3/3 is better than 2/3
cuz they have the best vids lol	that was such a crap meme that it was good
its one of the most rundown dorms lol	i feel like those extra spaces won't be used as much
but i heard they have one of the best dorm cultures	i did notice some of the lights looked like they were falling off lol
the one that by far has the nicest dorm is simmons	kevin says if you wanna do stuff at horn pond you're welcome to come
they have a fricking ball pit	you're gonna get pink eye from that shit lol
(ugh to kevin, not to the pink eye)	i think i'll do body weight stuff with kevin
at the gym or not at the gy	probs just at horn pond
ok	so you're gonna work out in the morning and then maybe somehow come to the school later lol?
but interesting	you should probably let him know now then
ya he already said yes	this si some weird shit man
i know mit has especially strong dorm loyalty/culture so thats why it makes a big difference which dorm ur in	west hall is only for honors kids
ah	or out on the hills
i feel like even if u spend ur days in labs your social environment is still gonna play a really big role in ur life quality tho	why do you think i'm going to keep skating?
 explore what kind of person you are and what kind of person you want to be around in the future, bc you're not gonna get something like college agian	🐱
you'll find weed everywhere	weed wonderland
this is the other dorm i'm considering, but everyone wants this dorm so i probaly won't get it	https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7v0td9/oregon_is_producing_three_times_more_marijuana/
holy	the simmons videos isn't as funny
the curved walls are connecting different floors	jeezus, i recognize that thing
the curved walls make up the lounges	i'm curious how the force is distributed through that whole thing then
i'm not really talking about academics tho	what makes you think that it's such a time to expand like that? technically, wouldn't that detract time from honing our skills further?
and i feel like your only counting things u have a strong interest in at this very moment	yeh that's true
like for example i have no idea if i would enjoy for example improv or singing or like dancing but i might as well try and figure out	i meme soft robotics, but that stuff is quite innovative and novel
bruh	ooohhh
step outside of robotics	that kind of stuff?
for a minute	can't you take that as a class though
ya but you wouldn't in the future if u didn't k u whether or not ur interested	feels like i'm missing a vital component to this sentiment, leading to me not understanding it
that probably won't relate to my career in the future	things like philosophy have a use later though, like that would be something i'll try out
ever again in ur life really	hmmmmm
its just something i do to develop myself more in ways that are not knowledge or academic	so it would be on the same categorization of things like playing games?
well	a good way to approach this would then to be stick with what you know for sure you want to do, and spare time to just try some other stuff even if tha
 to spend on traveling if i had the chance bc it would open my eyes a lot of things aroudn teh world and would just be like a life-changing experience	yeh i see that. on other hand i would only travel to places not to experience them but rather to see and learn what advances they have made in relatio
are you meme surfing through reddit again	yeh
🐱	http://robohub.org/new-battery-technology-is-accelerating-autonomy-and-saving-the-environment/
lol congrats	basically famous as shit now
oh woops	lol
nope max said he walked	lol
she's at my house rn cuz we just got back from the gym	bruhhhhhhhh
so i need to create some bs	holy shit
he said the grade is changeable if i send him some stuff	whew
ehh i'll only be gone for like 9 days	that's a lot of days
so it would just be us lol	yeh man lol
i'll see how much work i can get done	aight
ya. she's just chilling with chris and khloe while i do work lol	chris??
ya. he also had nothing to do today so he just walked over	lol
how are the robots going?	going well, not as far as i would've hoped
ya i will	how you doing
still writing my essay	still?? dang
im getting distracted cuz ashley just got home	sounds like confirmed no treehouse meeting lol
ya i think so. i have to do fam stuff with her so	tell her i said hi!
sarah is going through it and adding ppl	you're doing family stuff with sarah? lol
so we didn't do family stufff	ahh so you guys just hanging out now?
i'm still writing my essay :'(	lol bruh
i had to take an intermission to unscrew some nuts	what
ya...	did something bad happen?
i failed tho	what
ya...	what are you doing hanging around sarah that you would need to unscrew nuts lol
sarah's just kinda loitering here idk	lol
i'm working on my essay	she just wants to hang around you i guess
jk ily	love you too khloe
ok i'm back	good luck on finishing those essays
its like ^ those types of questions	that's dumb
but the program i'm applying for is apparently hard to get into	cuz you could meme the shit out of them and be the funny dude on campus
its the wierd life-changing one that happens in a lakehouse in groton, ma	like an honors program
no its the freshman pre-orientation program	sounds like a cult
so basicaly like 5 days before orientation there are some pre-orientation programs that are optional	why is there a special freshman pre-orientation one lol
its like 5 days of being around your new classmates	what would one do in those five days that's so life changing
i got recommended by a lot of students to do it bc its apparently worth it	number 5 is literally the stanford question lol
but its apparently life-changing	what is up with all these programs and wtf do you do in them lol
nah its not a final club tho, u apply for it and its just 5 days	that last part makes it seem like an elite thing lol
its just gonna be a fun 5 days	the dude said in the chat that the ppl who went are all leaders now
and also i'm pretty sure its just ppl who are more prone to be leaders attend flp	if dat ain't some cult shiz idk what is
not all of them are leaders lol	is that part of the reason why you want it? lol proving thy self
are u ok today	yeh though someone is calling me rn complaining about their problems and i'm so sleepy lol
lol ok. no its not proving anything	is that why you asked about the are you okay today?
and also i get to meet other ppl who may be like-minded	passive aggression waists time, if one wanna fronts they better front fast
maybe u should get some sleep man	yeh but idk how to end this convo
who's calling u?	lol that would be funny just start snoring
ah	don't worry dude
🐱	🐱
and its something to do with leadership	perhaps you get to meet and talk to famous alumni
i doubt it. we're in a lakehouse in groton ma lol	and then make out with ppl
idk if they're gonna ship noam chomsky out to groton	it's actually where the last remains of the lsd group lives
true its been hiding in the shadows	lol
lmaoo	i got a boost of energy somehow
i need to finish and edit them first	did ya finish? cuz sounds like you've got a lot of packing from the sci oly chat
i'm pretty much done packing	has your mother always been so tightlaced?
so all these restrictions are more apparent	lmaoo
lol she probably called me after u fell asleep	yeh...
i was mindblown by ben tho	when ben is in bro mode i suppose he's different lol
like extremely different	idk i didn't really understand the problem fully. to me it seemed like rhea was jealous of how much time ben spent with litzy
i mean its a well documented phenomenon, choosing between the bros or the hoes once a close friend gets into a relationship	lol
that's what i thought it boiled down to	yeh that sounds about right
🐱	🐱
ya	it's like if he got into a cool new hobby
its treehouse club except just us lol	yeh sure man lol, we've had that stuff a lot already
sarah will be in the dominican	if you're trying to tell me you're gay, sorry man i'm into girls
🐱	lol what, jenn and vara are going on a roadtrip? that's an odd team to go on a roadtrip i feel
jen and vara are pretty close tho	really???
damn that was quite the reaction	i know jenn said that the rwdc group was one of the most favorite groups she worked with so i was assuming that she and vara also had friction
 and jen got closer bc jen became good friends with joanna, and then joanna match jen and harry together which brought her closer again to joanna/vara	what the
ya	wow, this got nerdy even when we're talking about stuff that could almost be considered gossip
also poor jeremy is always 3rd or 5th wheeling lol	poor dude getting the short end of the stick :'(
and most of the ppl he hangs out with are joanna's friends	awww
which book?	the raibert one
this may be the start of the church of the divine thrustin	yeh right
its basically how i remembere	ahhhhh
?	it was a treehouse meme
lol wut	there's apparently a rap lyric about bringing a girl to a penthouse and "freaked on it"
lol wut	yeh same lol
i'm staying there basically the whole time	isn't shanghai an electronics powerhouse rn?
shenzhen is the main electronics powerhouse	oohhh thats right
however, it does seem a lot more things are automated now, even in the rundown city suburbs	really? what things are?
the toilets in the airport were pretty impressive, they had like buttons and shit	lol
i forget exactly what, its just my impression	can't tell if you're joking or not since that actually makes sense
it just seems more advanced than last time i visited	what?? really?? i always thought of china as not the cleanliest, i remember talking to some college kids from shanghai and they claimed they hated how
its still pretty dirty	ahh ic ic
like nonexistant	that's how you can really tell how advanced a civilization is
🐱	🐱
idk yet, are you free those days?	yeh sure what days doe
not sure yet	what time do you get back on the 19th?
probably be available the 20th and onward	what exactly do you want to talk about lol
just whenever ur free and wanna hang out	ahh yeh so just hanging out like after the last conference?
ya i'm psychologically fine	well that's a relief lol
we can hang out anytime	i'm also rather behind on the raibert book and shiz
or whatever the number was	oh we could also watch some of the towatch movies like blade runner 1 & 2 along with that time travel one you've mentioned
how much do u have left?	~150 pages lmao
that's good	it's kinda crazy to think about
but ya i agree	i don't know if it's really a dark place per se right
its only wierd cuz obviously we can never imagine what not being concious feels like	yeh and the fact that our consciousness and more so of who we are as persons/beings heavily rely on our past experiences and memories and other people
🐱	🐱
its 3 am isn't it	yeh i should but i'm listening to the wisecrack podcast about one of their writers who wrote the nier automata story
 if the ball can just print bodies when it thinks ppl are dead, can the ball just print an entire army using the ppl he's already printed as templates	oh the dead people part was more of not to mess around with human society too much
anime has such a wide range	yeh right
their whole fusing thing should be limited by the hardware inside major	the brief explanation they had seemed to me that the cyber brain was more of an addition to the current brain
holy shit gt memes strike again	righttt
ugh hot and dusty	dusty? really
similar to apple pay	i kinda like cash doe, since i ain't got no bank shit before as a younging
ya its basically only kids who carry cash on them, and even then a lot of them just have a joint account with their parents	damnn
its listening capabilities are also worse but overall can do the same things and functions the same way	i can see potential concerns though with a social media platform that's government promoted and dominates more than just media (like pay)
i mean they aren't potential concerns if the chinese gov already actively censors all media	i'm guessing they can easily replicate the hardware once they get one and see the documentation
the exxterior was also less slick and felt more plasticky	ok maybe not all the hardware lol
i don't think the ai is that bad and it seems like there are functionalities that alexa can't do	ooohhh
but it has the same light loop thing at the top and its functionalities are basicaly the same	not sure what mi means but doesn't xiao mean small? kinda like micro soft (with micro being a synonym for small)
xiao mi means little rice lol	what
the ai itslef is called "xiao ai" which is a spin on ai which sounds like "love" in chinese	small love?
did u go to six flags?	ahh that makes sense
nice	very quality engineering on those rides, but idk if i can handle another day on those things lmao
cuz the same xiao ai software is also used on xiao mi phones as their version of siri	#hardwareisstillafieldofpriority
how about friday?	yeh sure that sounds good
probably yours.	kkkkk
cyaa	shall we stay at botball until 4 and then hang out at my place tomorrow?
i actually might not be able to go to botball today bc i have a lot of work to catch up on after china	lol wut
like 8	lol
probably	sounds good
i'm leaving my house now	kkkk
rip	welp shit
oh sweet thanks	no problemo
🐱	lol
*clean	yeh that’s the trick though
definitely not my room	what about a drone trashcan
he has some pretty sweet arcs	what was one those sweet arcs? i need my memory jogged
and becomes super successful and at some point i think u can choose to work for him	danggg
i don't think i would stick with doing the same thing for over a decade	really? that’s interesting, yeah you do seem like there’s a lot you want to pursue and try out
ya i should be	wanna try to watch some bladerunner or death note?
did all the parts come in?	yeh, the programmer came in
i was already asleep and then i woke up and accidentally opened my phone lol	lmaoo
i fucked up	? did you forget to message sarah about meeting up or something lol
john dunleavy	uh oh
in my mind i thought it was brian dunleavy who had his account hacked	ooohhh
t could have been a lot worse. cuz i know brian dunleavy is kinda an asshole cuz i went to elementary school with him, so i was about to be super rude	lol
idk i feel bad now	if it makes you feel better, from reading the chat nothing seems wrong/bad
how late did u guys end up calling yesterday?	i think it was close to 1 or something?
nervous in waht way	she's nervous about if you really want to go for it (the relationship) and stuff
i'm kinda nervous too	oh are you guys not meeting late night today?
i think its a no	you're gay????
and according to ashley, everything changes up in college. theres a lot of perspective shifts and stuff as you deal with a completely new environment	hmm interesting
was she very much for going for it when u guys talked?	i don't know if she was super for it
to be honest i also don't know to what degree i like sarah since i don't think i've actually super intensely liked anyone before	really??
like since sarah is such a close friend, i don't like her in the butterflys in ur stomach / blushing way	have you ever met someone you just couldn't stop thinking about?
nah not really tbh	ahh, yeh that does sound more "comfortable" like you said before
or not to an extreme degree	maybe you'll find the one to give you butterflies in collegio
maybe	just don't get infatuated lol, that's dangerous
wtf is that	it's a banana with three cores it seems
it looks like that pokemon	yeh no one wants that kind of obsessive person lmao
but the resemblance is kinda there	isn't that based on a pitcher plant not a banana? lol
ya lol	i gotta say though
maybe deep down i just know im meant to be single forever	lmao
lmao	hmm
and when i get a more intense crush i bury myself in work	🐱
ya...	i'm sure you'll meet a good friend group at mit
well ur friends in college are gonna be centered a lot around ur clubs and activities	or centered around weed
i know i'm joining hackmit, which i heard is a really tight friend group so at least i know i'll have some friends lol	guessing that's a software hackathon?

pulling an invite another person move	lmao
or like she reacted badly when u told her about me looking for jen	nah nah nothing happened to sarah, it was when we were hanging out and you wanted to find jenn
wait this year?	yeh sarah said she would be fine no matter what the story was, but then she was like, "oof"
but i also recongize if i go with it too much i could hurt sarah even more later if we don't end up dating	yeh that's very true
maybe i'll just ask her	oooh, good thinking
but i'm not sure lol	exactly lol, i feel like she sometimes just says stuff and then can't handle it later

does he have a secretary?	lol wut
grad students === secretary	yeh tru
what did he say?	if i piss on the equipment that would fuck shit up
lmao	no classes were open
god has a sense of humor	it’s called art 204 and it’s on ancient art
the most useless topic in the most useless subject	🐱
🐱	i’m afraid that i might be turning in a jerk
the next time we talk i'll be spewing buzzwords	a couple reminded me of less chill cheng
it was actually insane and it's put me in an interesting thought spiral	ahh sorry i was out with katie and her friends
wow damn you and katie are hittin it off	interesting music, idk what genre it even is lol
or maybe that's jsut how she talks to animals	idk about that lol, she's kinda like julia kim in that she's quiet, but i notice she's talking more and more now
oh ic	in my defense i have tried making guy friends
lol wut	yeh idk why either
is that agility?	nah
wait so ur in?	i guess so?
overwhelmed in what way?	i’ll explain in detail once i’m out of the lab
see it all worked out	nah
to a lot of things	this sounds familiar...
fucj ducj fuck fcuj fuck	lol first step is to take a deep breath
but who has ti me to make friends	i should disagree with you
betwee 12:45 and 1 pm every other thursday	every other thursday?
true	you and sarah both seem to have scooped a lot on your plates
ew why matlab	cuz it’s built in differential equation solvers
there's a reason usually grad students work on these projects	yeh that’s why i need to be better
what math do u need to do?	but i don’t have much time so i need to be here as much as i can
idk what that means but it sounds complex lol	same
🐱	what companies though?
both are looking for senior -- grad level talent	yoooo skydio????
they spun out of nick roy's lab	i see you’re into writing books already
the technology seems super cool	ooohhh that’s more in line with your interests
and they implement machine learning	that tech is dangerous
ya its pretty dangerous and can def be used for unethical purposes	they can use that to track you watch out for big brother dick stallman told js
i think its definitely gonna be a very impactful technology, hopefully not used unethically	ahhh ic ic
"it must need so much machine learning and all of the blockchain"	one senior i know literally plopped his own pc at a space and now it’s his
they did a demo, it was so cool	i can’t even fathom how they trained it so well
so we'll see how much i can finesse	what kind of companies are those?
they're gonna start selling the 1000 shipment, the 100 shipment will be for internal tests g	sounds about right
ceramic animal made a music video :o	holy shut
damn r u already working on cassie?	lmao
🐱	have you organized yourself with the overflow of commitment?
but a bit less busy now that career fair is over	that’s good to hear
more time for social stuff i guess	feeling more confident now too?
also i'm probably gonna start going to parties now	do you actually like the party life? lol
but i was planning on staying away from the party life bc it's a lot of hooking up and bad decisions	but now you want to hook up and make bad decisions?
🐱	ahhh
i don't think she was planning on telling me until idk when	hooking up with some rando probably isn’t the best way to cope with that though
lol ya ik i'm not actually gonna hookup	yeah, she was distraught about how to go about it and time just happened to pass
i guess it didn't matter to begin with	hmmm
i was talkling to sarah at 2 am and she said she was having a week of "emotional hell" cuz of harvard and being stressed about acapella and stuff	yeh?
ne that strongly denied that she would find lots of other guys who she would like at harvard. aand she said i would be the one "on the hunt" for girls	yeh it is rather ironic how things happened
alright maybe i'm not over it....	hmm yeah it would appear so
sorry for the rant	boiling for almost a week
when she told me, i basically died on the inside but kept up tryna be a supportive friend on the outside	yeh she mentioned your ears turned super red
then i walked home in the rain	holy shit did you really walk??
it was only like 30 min	hey on the bright side that makes for a great opening to a movie
🐱	🐱
it only took 4 days to decide	hot damn
wdym	do you want to still be with sarah
i don't think it will bring up any negative feelings	are you sure about that?
unless for some reason sarah doesn't wanna be friends or thinks its awkward now haning out with me	it’s not your friendship that i’m worried about in this case. it’s your feelings
given the fact that i doubt she will put in that much effort to make it happen and its also kinda sketch now that she has a bf	yeah that's true
its just a weird mixed feeling of irony	sounds like heartbreak
like a situation where you thought it would go one way and it goes the complete opposite way for no good reason	it seemed both of you guys didn't expect this result
i was afraid of this result	you also seemed pretty irked by the whole four days thing too
🐱	i would commit suicide
🐱	hmmm you wanna call about it?
and i'm with my frat rn. i'm just sulking in the corner and furiously typing lmao	lol bruh
itll take some time but i think things will be ok	alright that's good to hear
lol	holy shit dude
wait so i'm still confused as to what work ur doing	i’ve never been so happy to see a graph before
what about the slip model are u working on	i’m creating it
i'm currently studying for midterms lol	shit wut lol
well there are like 4 midterms per semester	lol wut
this is for physics. other classes do it differently but all classes tend to have tests this week or next week	that’s kinda gross
wiat how many tests do u guys have?	fuk
rip	just a regular old midterm and final
yup	you’ve been feeling alright though right?
wdym you've been learning about wellness?	it’s part of my required kickboxing/health class
i've actually been eating pretty healthy	really???
which feels wierd	that’s one step closer to being poor
but i've been tryna hit 2 fruits a day and half veggies for dinner	the poor lonely starving grad student
the high school gym class is working	why you hitting two gays and half of a comatose person woman
lmao wut	fruits and veggies
r gay ppl fruits	lmao i wish high school gym class worked earlier
what if u find ur true passion in art history	hey don’t joke about that shit
im also kinda scared that thing u mentioned will happen sometime soon and the show will become shitty	lol nah that thinking of art i think only appeared starting around the impressionist to the current post modernism contemporary movement
also is the thing ur talking about with death note the ppearnace of the girl kira	i'll be honest i have no idea what my data readouts are really saying rn lol, kevin, the phd student, just walked by and said hey that data looks grea
ya her charater is knda irritating	wait a sec
but holy fuck i hate this character	🐱
🐱	lol
falling behind?	dude my ece class is full of kids who don't even know what a photoresistor looks like rn
u wouldn't have this opportunity anywhere else	i had to explain to my lab partner in physics who was a sophomore how uncertainties worked
usually the downside to doing that is u get swamped and hate life	yeah, maybe i'm freaking out too early rn
probably mostly upperclassmen	yeah i've been around the lab's upperclassmen and they've been cool af
but u guys have a hackathon coming up i think	but i only see them in the lab and stuff
u should actually go just to scout out ppl	you know how i feel about software hackathons lol
bc ur stuck in this room for 24 hrs just working on tech shit for fun	isn't that just the lab?
well with labs ur not sleep deprived and under as much pressure	my moment of worry was when i realized i've only laughed the hardest around the lab
u can always create filters	yeah i suppose so
i feel like if u cling onto the possibility u will be leaving in a yr it might dampen things	yeah that's true
but i'm really excited about my urop	is that like a sex thing?
yes	nice dude
🐱	oh yeah, your urop with the nlp people right??
by mit	if i haven't said it before, congrats!
and i think i made the right choice	yuhhh
i can't type it all out rn cuz my hands are taped	lol wut
i'm in the middle of an assassins game with my frat	that's uh, huh
i have to hold a spoon in my right hand to stay alive	ohhh
yee	do you slap people spoons outta their hands?
but this way i can write while having it in my hand	huh lol
lol like $25 or smthn	that's not bad tbh
if u factor in the free food game at mit	i thought you were eating more healthy rn lol
which should absorb the cardiovascular disease bc something superfoods and gluten free	don't forget about your fertility super powder
nah ashley took that with er	oh shi, don't worry dude
ng page, and they start talking emacs and they have an external reference link which i thought would be a tutorial, but they just link that xkcd comic	lol
i'm working on their computers not mine	oh shi, 14.04??
im using one of their older computers	lol bruh
i actually should probably gtg	lol yeah, sounds gucci
lol thanks	shit dude
shoot	lol wait shit i’m skating rn
lmk	back
ya why don't u just study math today?	yeh, apparently a former lab member is on it now lol
🐱	i just don't know if i'll get quality studying tonight
why not?	hw
how hard is the math class?	idk, not that hard rn at least in terms of the current material that was covered
rip	yeh right
but ya it feels longer	dude you didn’t say no homo wtf
🐱	dude the guy who was on survivor, the roboticist
wait but why did the girl ask if he wanted to play	idk, the show has romance sometimes -> showmance
lol but still thats a wierd seduction "do you want to play with me"	tbh nothing smells yet so i bet we have another three months
wait dont u guys have janitors/cleaning crew?	we have one for the hall itself, but since the private bathrooms are connected to each of our rooms we’re responsible for it
oh ic	oly fuck dude
have u heard this song?	no, i’ll give it a listen soon
i'm not in the bu area	*whew
yup	what did ya guys do?
and thats pretty much it	awwww
i don't think she wouldve made it back on her own lol	oh did she drink?
but not a lot	dude do you know what to do if your hand just can’t grip as hard anymore
wfym	yeh idk either
r u losing grip strength	idk when i woke up today i just couldn’t hold my phone with my right hand
shit dude i should get that checked out	nah it’s ok
is ur hand ok now?	eh kinda
ya go ahrad	i just went to the robotics club kickoff and meeting stuff for each team
do u enjoy what they do?	i've never done full on underwater before
cuz from what it sounds like they will def pile up responsibilities	and i also see what you mean by not everyone has the same drives as you
? wdym	as i was talking to one of the leads they mentioned they wanted to try to program an fpga for the robot so they could do everything onboard, but it wo
🐱	ok, got sarcastic there
i mean just from how ur describing it it doesn't seem like u would enjoy ur time	fuk dude, i even told them i could dabble and see how much i could set up
why would it be rude	lmao
how many hrs a week would u be happy spending on robotics	i spend at least 2 hours a day in the lab
lol	so if i just walk in and be like, fund me and let me use your resources, but i'm not going to be on any of your sub-teams
well if u take their money then u have an obligation	they told me don't feel obligated
lol ya it's rude now that u mention the money part	but i do
and is it worth the money	that's the problem i'm still on the research phase of the leap mechanism, disney doesn't really document their work that well it seems
1) is the money specifically meant for personal projects	i guess it would be a good way to keep my ros skills from rusting, esp since ros is way too bulky for walking robots rn
municate with them to set expectations. tell them u only have time to spend 3 hrs a week on robotics and if they think it's not enough just don't join	the way it works is that each subteam from rover to underwater has their own separate budgets
just make sure u don't get set with any permanent responsibilities	danger's my grandmother's surname
u fucking old man wut	sorry, shitty, not well planned joke
ur not gonna really be able to quit in a week	personally, i thought that was way too sudden
especially you cuz you'll be like "well it'll be so rude if i blahblahblah"	all i asked was if they use ros, got a no answer, get pulled aside by one of the leads -> huge discussion -> them pushing me to join and telling me wh
i feel like u gotta be in or out. if u can make it clear that u don't want to have any big responsibilities u should be fine	what do you mean especially cuz it's me?
🐱	that was pretty good
but i feel like u are a bit too generous with giving out ur time	now that i think about it, i got into the rwdc team since i offered to help them choose what motors and batteries to use
 u gotta just make it clear to ppl. there are other times to be polite, but not when it's concerning what u want to do with ur life and precious tkme5	i got into auxivision since i said i could make a small prototype
🐱	🐱
setting those expectations	yeah that's true,
what's the other lab?	human robot interaction
the wut	the charisma lab
what kind of human robot interaction	various
🐱	i appreciate you inviting me to the theta xi coffee night
holy shit i can't believe someone made the finger thing	ikr
amirite	i don’t get it
🐱	my biggest news of the last week
that was really cool	oohh ic ic
i've seen that	it's quite the compelling data
yo	ye?
i was just bored lol	nioce bruh
how much did you partition for ubuntu?	out of my 1tb harddrive
but i need to leave some for windows cuz i'm still gonna be using it	only 85 gb???
ye	what the heck is eating up more than 100 gb on your window side
windows is just a hoe	on ssd (124 gb total)/         75 gb/usr    25 gb/boot 24 gbon hdd (900 gb total)/home 800 gb/var      50 gb/tmp     50 gb
i already cleared out as much as i can	feelsbad
look at this fucking hoe	yeah that's ridiculously huge lol
and not do home	oh btw you don't need that much space for boot on your ubuntu sys, like 250 mb will do, i overdid it
i can always back up things on my external hd if i wanna update distros	are you not going to lose those external hd's though?
how much did u partition for linux on ur old computer	i know a guy here who velcro's his external hd's to his laptop
for ubuntu	oh that was the thinkpad
isn't that process really annoying	eh it was aight, just half an afternoon spent on it
and how did you use it all up	yeah pretty much
the onlyy thing i'm worried about is i might want to download a bunch of datasets for future projects	robot simulations that i never used since thinkpad would freeze
oh ic	those datasets you can probs slap onto an external hd though right
ya	back at booz allen they bought specific servers for datasets and ether-netted them to their main computers
but ya i guess as long as i don't install a shit ton of package	well fuk them then, that's the spirit of open source
i should be fine with maybe 60?	and use the other ~25 for system stuff?
i'll leave 25 for windows	yeah i suppose that would work
and i won't do home, just a root partition	60 gb would probs be running it super tight if you're going to do a lot of high level programming though
well	the only problem i see would be if you're doing stuff you might need to spend time on space management
are ros and opencv huge packages	maybe like half a gb if you only get the bare bones
so like my anaconda package is about 11 gb, and it has all the python scientific libraries included	holy shit
i'm probably not gonnna be doing a lot of simulation models	oh in that case i bet you'll be fine with 60 gb
did you store a lot of like videos or smthn	maybe
🐱	i don't think republicans are allowed to exist on college campuses
you could be an art historian	like i always knew this shit was expensive, but now i'm actually here it's mindblwoing
and to answer ur question i feel like that literally every day lol	lol it’s aight i was just doing health hw and looking at the new bd videos
also i'm making dinner rn so i'm down for a call	i’m sitting here doing health hw while others are making shit
ok	wow dry is so much worse lol
i didn't realize it was that low	lol
ye	you still wanna chat or you good?
https://youtu.be/3sau5racsge?t=263	 foxy roxy called you.
: )))))))))))))))	🐱
🐱	🐱
which was probably the right move	i agree to that, especially if you have a lot of work piled up
also apparnetly while we were calling today, sarah was calling sam	lol
rip	yeah, you two just never are in the same place at the same time for some reason
*bonding	was that a freudian slip?
🐱	wait, hadrian was gay?
or rather bisexual	it's probably the water they drank
🐱	🐱
things u learn from 4 yrs of latin	oh my god what
🐱	how's your intro to ml course been?
how was ur midterm?	midterm was easier than i expected, thought there would be more conceptual questions
looks like bds tryna ramp up their marketing strategy	ooh around the level of ng huh?
dude i've been going to bed before 2 every day its actually crazy	lol
just like cmu	yeah that seems to be the smart trend i think
probably for my class it would just end up being some extra beauracracy cuz some of the programs i'm in will be transferred to other schools etc	but if you do your masters in cs i bet you could enjoy the building if enough and prominent profs move in on time
🐱	did you know industry and academia has different definitions of some variables and processes of pid controllers?
well i feel like it's not a surprise that industry wouldn't be standardized	i’m surprised they don’t teach us that in harvard business school
wait also elaborate on the finding others attractive thing	like i thought most people (or at least guys) tended to really want to find gf's or be in a relationship or other stuff (hence the traditional frat)
there are plenty of attractive ppl at mit but that doens't mean i want to get into a relationship with anyone yet	lol
🐱	oh shit man
i wonder if i screenshotted that moment in the story	there’s something making me think that you’re still not 100% over it not sure though, could just be the water that’s making the frogs gay
also i don't think i screenshotted it	yeah i couldn’t find it in our shared picture history thing
that's tammy i think lmao	priorities lol
yup	where did they go for under?
but probably the one where i end up homeless	lol nah dude you’ll burn your name into the world
like experiencing deja vu in a dream	turned out there’s a term for it
lol w\ut	yeah same
this is like when u decide to work on ur robot instead of hanign out with josh	fuk dude
someone mailed a bomb to my house and now my right arm is missing	dude when i saw the preview to your message i almost had a heart attack lol
oooh thanks	i notice every associated with that course are majority east asian or indian
?	i'm going to just go to the lab instead and do work there
elaborate on da feelz	i just get all tired and angsty when i'm not in the lab i notice
🐱	that is not what i meant lol
hmmmm	idk, talking/thinking about this kinda stuff always makes me feel like an asshole for even feeling that way lol
i'm revenge meming u for all the "i'm justin yu" memes	lol
ya so first of all u gotta stop beng a wus and just say no	every time we interact it's her asking me to help her with robotics, computers whatever
dude these signalzzzz	she has a boyfriend
"roy can you come over and fix my hardware"	holy fuk
so you don't feel like u have like a squad?	i feel like i don't need one and i don't particularly want one
wait so what socila activities do u do	hang out in the lab
so u only go on social things with ur lab? lol	holy shit
lemme plug this into my recurrent neural network	are you going to blockchain the cloud too?
fuck bad timing	lmao
sorry go on lol	nah that's about it tbh
like the alumni themselves are not interesting or you are not interested in them lol	like look at this dude who was an ece bs from here, he's making chips at a boring ass office job in a random ass company
oh so corporate life	yeah fuck man
hmm	i think it may be the horror of mediocrity that's setting upon me, perceived of by myself in my own mind of my environment
wait elaborate	i came here for the lab right
outside of ur lab	yeah
even outside of the school. idk if the city itself has meetups	bruh, i live in the forest
but i feel like you should branch out of ur lab	why do i need to be social outside of the robotic labs
if you put aside silly things like mental health	lmao
ne field lol2. you always want to have a network of ppl to support you when u need it both emotionally and for future jobs or opportunities and such	for the first one, i'm already taking art history, it'll be fine i bet
lmao	maybe i should check out that asian american people thing
ya do it	or i could become a full on lab rat like in the game
at least for me	lmao fuk, time to boot up latex
i'm only really looking at startups	you going try skydio?
tho u can cheese it and still apply but my resume isn't strong enough regardless	show them up, show them your brilliance and they’ll have to take you
so we'll see	oh damn that’s intense
they're a startup spun out of mit and have some pretty cool ppl on their staff so i think it would be a good way to learn	and also emailing massrobotics again
what about just intenring for agilitiy?	lol i have no idea if i’m good enough for agility
they'll probably at least consider u for an interview	i only just got a controlled slip model system barely working like last week, which i still need to work out some specific bugs
also remember, the highest financial cost of hiring is not wages but onboarding	i guess i could still ask
since u won't really need onboarding u should have a good advantage	worst case scenario i go back to booz allen
can't u get summer housing on campus?	agility is a 20 minute drive from campus
bike	it’s rural af outside of campus
lol	first i suppose i’ll get my resume in order and then get on other stuff
🐱	well shit you’re not wrong
i pulled mine out of bill gates ass	i know, but i need to learn it anyway, all the grad students use it for their hw
sorry i'm tired	holy shit
what is that protruding out of his midsection then	that’s supposed to be the dick
ohhh i thought u meant the body was suppose to be the dick lmao	this whole paper is about dicks
and his head is just on the head of a dick	lol
don't even have full body dicks	there’s a whole paragraph about how the athenians loved little dicks
smh	that’s why their empire fell
they didn't really have an empire	virgin athenians vs the chad spartans
only predominance in the delian league	well i’m sorry if an empire is irrelevant to artistic pursuit
that's right i paid attention in 6th grade	lol
i wanted to be a historian in elementary school	oh yeah i recall you mentioning that
holy shit	here’s a question
wait i'm in gym class but imma give an answer in a bit	lol the question only rose up since ppl were discussing ai/robots taking jobs and stuff during a symposium
this is just my intuition + basic economics, so i could b completely wrong	baidu demos stacl (simultaneous translation with anticipation and controllable latency), the first simultaneous machine translation system with antici
like ubi and shit	dude
oof literally every day at mit makes me wish i were smart	it's a bit of a long story
rip	oh shi, then i should probably leave you back to studying
blame sarah	i'll lol
🐱	no
r u just going around chadding ppl	otherwise i was moving robots around with the grad students late night for some conference/events
on graduation day u should just go up to him and rip his diploma	lol
oh ya wiat why do u need to be more assertive	i'll tell ya another time, since you have midterms tomorrow
damn lol	good luck man!!
thxx	🐱
hbu	insecure?
ye just some bad feels when im tired and sick	it’s not about sarah right
nah nah	oohhh
idk im just feeling behind on a lot of things	behind?
so basically i'm spending a lot of time doing shit and losing out both ways	lol
or at least with me	there's an easy fix for that, step 1: be hot
thanks man lol	lol no problemo, i'm here for ya
ya i just end up doing work pretty late and then when i get back to bc ppl are all asleep	do you feel more concerned about the social aspect or the experience/intellectual aspect?
the social one bc that's the part i'm not good at	so you feel as if you aren't connected with anyone due to your lack of hanging out with anyone consistently
ye i guess	what do you want to do about it?
it just feels kinda shitty	yeah i suppose so
its probanly cuz ive been averaging 3-4 hrs the past week	yeah you best take that nap jyu
as do i but still	i don’t care that vitamins a,d,e, and k are fat soluble
🐱	i’ve been pondering about people saying one needs to have a work life balance
i think the pt is for most ppl if u don't balance it then it gets unhealthy to the pt where the total productivity is less	how can one be unproductive if all they do is work
is this what ur health class is teaching u	yeah teaching me propaganda
i'm going to bed early tonight too	oh damn
no homo	<3
i have a blind date on saturday lmao	holy shit what
it's a "floormal" but basically u dress up fancy and then throw a rager lol	what the
it's just a floor tradition lol	ohhh
lol why	cuz these computers are meant for printing
wait what did the fifth yr senior do to u	i technically sit at an open space in the lab right, but i’ve settled there so much now that the grads call it roy’s desk right
🐱	he’s also got a high pitched voice
damn i haven't seen u get this heated about anyone in a while	he’s obstructing work
why don't u just point out that he's using a laptop when there are spaces for laptops	i did when i first asked him to move
i think u gotta be less nice roy	yeah
u gotta go out and chad ppl	what i just don’t get is why he’s being a bitch like dat
u just have to be comfortable with asserting something that u believe is rightfully urs	next time i'll grab his laptop and throw it on the ground
🐱	🐱
my expectations are low	why so?
it'd be nice to get a friend out of this tho	ayyy, that's a good attitude
thanks man lol	of course of course
is that the 3d printed one	yeah it was a calming experience
did u k they were defeated by 3 teddy bears	🐱
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3c5gn15kas	lol wtf
no its a big meme	like the last jedi?
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee	lol
oints in the last jedi such as rose and the canto byte sequences but they do not render the entire film and all of its cinematic achievements obselete	oh my god i can't believe you camelcasememed that whole thing
to breastfeed in public	how do we know those aliens are female
im writing an essay i just started today thats due in 10 hrs	past 3 am it’s morning my man
ya u should also be asleep man	holy fuck i just puked all over my bed
are you ok	yeh idk what happened
does it actually work like that	what do you mean by does it actually work like that?
lol	the old one just couldn’t
woah that's actually pretty cool	ikr
ixing this shit cause i’m just playing lol u my bitch. send this to 10 people to scare them. happy halloween u candy corn licking bitch lmao. love you	did sarah send that to you?
ya lol	you ever have moments of philosophical introspective as you take a piss?
not specifically when i take a piss	huh
the only things i've been grinding are psets	fuk, my times are off
😫	wow when you put it that way
? no	the virgin group
wut	
what the	"richard branson founded the virgin group, which controls more than 400 companies"
i didn't k they were all on the same group	yeah dude it's insane
lmaooo	dude i finally did it
?	i finally asked a girl out
hold on	nah i’m just fucking with ya
🐱	know me so well :’)
🐱	🐱
but they asked one of the bros for my number after the party so they must know my name so they must have talked to me	or they know someone who talked to you and asked them what’s the name of that “cute boy”
true tbh most likely	hey at least they didn’t call you nice
wait is that a reference	lol yeh man
ya.....	i’ve basically ascended (ethan)
lol thamks	how was the date
also my dates happening at 10	apparently they theorize the new art style reflects the new sense of government and social structure in which your position and title is more importan
the party started 30 min ago	wait
from cow and befire	"i was already know her"
o lo  k3km	wanna vid call?
but i can call in a bit	damn feelsbad
charge	be careful then, don’t end up drunk and no form of communication!
wait what part made you stop watching?	lol
was it when l died	i just found mello and near to be a bit too absurd as successors to l
holy fuck the ending tho damn my heart rate spiked so hard	well shit man i didn’t get far enough for mello to not be important any more lol
wait have u watched the ending then?	yeah, i eventually saw that later
the whole concept of death note is so cool	hm something about the idea
lmao	but then again last night you were complaining about not having a gf and being lonely
if you cut out his more crazy god ramblings and just focus on the fact he reduced global war and crime by 70% in 5 years	i mean hilter also produced some good statistics too, but it’s hard to ignore his crazy ramblings lol
from a utiltarian perspective the ends absolutely do justify the means	but the world doesn’t only work in one perspective
but not nearly as many guilty ppl	it’s best not to trade lives, #captainamerica
ya alright captain that's why he traded ten thousand wakanda lives just so he could try to save vision	well the clear reasoning for that is that wakandans aren’t americans
who's only interactions are through the medium of stone cold logic	oh like how in the beginning light and l could only interact through distant media’s like television
good	lol so many themes and topics that line up with you?
;alsdkfjlskdjflkasdjofipijaslkdfjkdjofpqowierjoifjoqijwef	lmao
the plot was so complex and logical too oh man oh man oh man this show was so good holy fuck	so uh, weeb huh?
lmao	is there anything new on your to watch list now?
so why would i watch a weeb show	code geass season 2 is hella wack
nahhhhh anime takes up so much time	lol
watching anime is so time expensive	wait, don't tell me you watched death note instead of doing hw lol
bc death note is ltierally right up my alley	lmao
yes basically	you need to watch cowboy bebop
cuz im not a weeb	cowboy bebop is _the_ show to get non-weebs to watch an anime
no avatar the last airbender is not an anime	the creators clearly say it's inspired by animes!
🐱	jesus-loving lmao
🐱	yeh cuz i'd rather focus on research rn instead of finding a gf
can't be a *fucking* bitch if ur such a fucking bitch ya know	there's also the moment when you called yourself the sun
or something	and also when you tried to find your pants, but lost your balance turning around
lmao did max send u the video	"i'm the sun bitch! i'm a fusion reaction!"
oh ya lol	nah i saw everything real time
fuuuuuuuuuk where are my pants?	i also like how you're still so considerate when max mention his laptop is there
i think im just gonna die alone	don't be a little bitch
ya i heard u were telling me to do it ya little shit	nah man, max and i just laid out the pros and cons for you
these are quotes from the movie	holy shit
also the force is dope	blocking gunshots with laser swords is a dumb concept
they're acutally midicholrians	how the fuk do bugs in your blood stream give you mind physic powers lol
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh	yeh ok man
also probably over winter break	oh shi
did he connect u with specific ppl?	no lol
is this for next summer?	where he spent a summer at the mit leg lab right before it closed up (i think by that time marc raibert left for bd for a while and gill pratt was dir
that's the 2nd stage of interviews so if i pass i'll be going in for a 3 hr in person interview	dayumnnn
an🗓⚖️election ass💦🍑eater😩if you get🔥five🔥back, u castin big booty🍑🍑ballots, && if you get🍆ten🍆back 👯🙏🏻💯we all gettin that erection🇺🇸day🇺🇸dick ⚖️💯🍆🔥💦👅😩	voting?
lol	what do you think this means
uh	and i have no idea how to vote when i'm on the west coast
well i guess u had to vote like a week ago lol	lmao
at least you know ur birthday is safe	yeah i suppose lol
thats my most up to date resume that i'm using	holy, your resume and even its base core of contents and what you’ve done is way better than mine
lol theres no such thing as better	idk man, you have way more experience than me
and companies do care about personal projects, even if its a bit sketchy as long as you can justify it later on in an interview ur all set	i can’t talk about what i’ve done with the contractors or the lab since it’s all confidential
*still talk about	i suppose so, we’ll have to see i suppose
hmm i mean you're working in a grad student lab, that's already really good	there are people who’ve done that since high school
bc were talking about a resume	oh yeh
your background experience is definitely impressive for a freshman, that's already a fact. you just need to package it in the right way	i’m pretty sure i’m just technically a volunteer here in the lab too
well ask someone what youre official title is	since i came in randomly one day, sat in a desk and started research without contacting the student programs
but i would check in with one of the grad students about what you should put yourself as	“volunteer researcher” i guess
ya that works too	yeh true
just don't put "volunteer"	idk why i suddenly had a freak out moment
meaning if you start bitching it becomes a positive feedback loop of bitching	lol what the
🐱	🐱
but in general i'm pretty shit	yeah i suppose that is a big and important factor
ye there we go	also i think matlab is a better language than python now
python for loops are so useful	i think python just doesn’t understand that
its probably not shit	the skeleton in terms of the order of stuff is kinda similar to yours now that i look at it again...
it doens't open	yeah, cuz windows rebranded it as .pdf even though i wanted the tag to be ambiguous
lmao	short resume.pdf
except the fonts don't all match up	lmao fuk
instead of it being sentences	da fuk is this convention
or something like that	aw shit, but doesn’t that take up more lines?
you ahve to play with the wording so you can be as close to a full line as possible for each bullet	is this what graphic designers do all day?
lol	don’t like how goddamn bland my resume is rn
probably wouldn't do that	aw man
you can mention it in your interview tho	what if the resume ppl are all small startups
then its up to you	hebi robotics is still like ten dudes from the same lab
oh i would maybe change your header tho, i feel like the white text on a blue background looks wierd	whattt
casually explained is fucking hilarious	lol
i'm shooting my first gun today lol	wait wut
today was shooting day	wait wut i thought your pe was just health class
that's for half a sem	🐱
what even is ancient jewish art	greek with red-figure decorations, so probably high classical or hellenistic period:
one of my fav tame impala songs covered by arctic monkeys 😍	"i got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.feels like we only go backwards darling."
this the og: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wycjnccgues	wut, you're into psych rock? i thought you didn't like bands like ceramic animals
actually most tame impala songs sound kinda the same but there are a few i really like	oh yup, that's definitely psych rock
i had a busy weekend of not psetting lol	ahhh
i've also started listening to the strokes a lot	bruh, why you on my wavelength rn
they're an interesting band that apparnetly alex turner got inspiration from	get off mah lambda
yoooo	i had no idea that the strokes were older than alex turner though
but i he was partly inspired by the strokes to start am	ah yeh i can see where that comes from
lol	lmao
bruh bruh bruh bruh	whoa
this is one fat lambda	i'm also on windows rn too
rip lol	yeh, either the velocity of this wave is super big or the frequency is super small rn
but ya yolo is such a good song	apparently the physics department here isn't that great, and if the teaching is any indication, whooo boi
also i remember i showed you a song by the strokes back in the summer and u didn't like reptilia	ye, my prof literally spent a whole lecture watching doppler effect videos and kinda just expected the kids to know the concept behind it
and damn ya that's like carlson	only problem is since we're on a quarter system the content gets swept by the speed
join a frat so u can be forced to be social	i haven't seen direct sunlight in two days
bruh that's actually concerning	didn't stan lee pass away yesterday?
i think u really need to add some social commitments man	i mean, i can still function in the lab, interacting with them hasn't really taken a hit
ya sleep is a good idea	da fuk you sorry for
i think it's a transition college thing	oh i did want your opinion on one thing i noticed last week in my ece class
ya..	idk, that just left a very bad taste in my mouth around for a while
lly since engineering takes so much work in terms of time and school, ppl r probably more inclined to talk about the fruits of the labor, namely wages	yeah, but that’s what bothers me so much here with the undergrads in engineering i’ve been around
e school so they probably catch a lot of the ppl who didn't really have a major interest in hs and are mainly looking at careers as ways to make money	yeah, that’s very true
ye...	time to learn football
or at least step outside ur room	or i can keep on banking on the lab for emotional support and just keep slowly breaking down every time i’m outside of it
lol no roy	i notice i rant mainly on the weekends when i’m out of the lab for long periods of time
ok i gtg sleep cuz it's 4:40	fuk damn sorry sorry
tell me about ur existential dread	lol
wdym	for a small startup looking for interns
what quality could u add by waiting	fuk time to submit
ya send it over i can read it rn if u want	nah it’s alright, you were already working on psets super late last night
but in terms of actual substance is there anything u can add?	you must have more urgent work rn
nah i wanted to take a break from studying anyways	idk, they’re an actuator company
🐱	no homo
done	oh damn you fast
its all good lol	damn, i think rethink was a prime perfect example of a company relying too much on a specific technology, the series elastic actuator, and refused to 
🐱	🐱
good luck!	thanks man
lol	oh shit
nah ive just been super hosed the past few days	you stressin'?
i feel like the material used would be very different tho for the two use cases even if they're both fiberglass	yeah that’s very true
lmaoo	you ever have those moments when you just feel like you haven’t done enough in the day?
also i recommend notebook scheduling, or scheduling on some other medium, its been helpful for me	damn that’s really optimistic of ya
e a pile of work to do, i find i'm not that efficient going through them unless i have solid deadlines for how much time i want to spend on each thing	lol i used to use the same style of notebook tasks from highschool, but i’ve found it takes too much time so i’ve just been spamming the shit out of m
lmao nice	yeh idk, sometimes i’m just mad at myself for still only being good enough for the work i’m currently doing and not the work i could be doing
any plans yet? or just chillin	continuing the research of jesse after he graduates with his masters
meh	really??
im tryna actually stop thinking about it so i can focus on some work i need to finish tonight	🐱
thanks for asking tho	https://youtu.be/4feusts21-8
lmao wtf	hey man, what can i say?
https://youtu.be/q3uy2kwod4q	idk if i wanna watch that lol
🐱	was that a jab at my impeccable music tastes
pleee don do cocaine *eh* cocain ruin yo brain *eh*	lmao
yup	fukkk now i really wish i was coming back for thanksgiving
its not too late	lo siento
damn	hey hey
but after tomorrow i'm freeee	yeee, get that good ol' sleep
wait holy shit happy birthday	lol
wait when is ur bday again	lol
oh ripp sorry man	lol no need to be sorry
how s thanksgiving?	lots of chinese restaurants lol
kinda like last shadow puppets from alex turner	yeh, i had to go out at night and attempt to find an open restaurant on thanksgiving dinner night
that's right bitch	🐱
what were u doing	i found some strange discoveries in my dynamics calculations and just hunkered down on it
also i just did a factory reset on my windows side lol	i planned out each half hour of my week last thursday and followed that
damn	🐱
we can update eachother on life	holy crap i need to listen to that song
also when do your finals end	wednesday
lol its all good	i need to read that emo piece you sent into treehouse
it'll make u wanna put on some black eyeshadow	and then listen to my chemical romance
its just me fucking around so no one will see them or anything	lol
it's not gonna be super complex so idk how good the results will be but we'll see	i swear if it turns out to be a homophobic right-leaning racist
lmao	how is it gonna work?
the one im playing around with is a seq2seq model. basically the nn takes in a sequence of characters and tries to predict characters that come after	wait so it doesn't exactly "understand" what it's saying but rather seeing the pattern?
anything with actual language understanding involved is complex as fuck and something im still tryna grasp	it might follow up with "the trans"
ya	i wanted to say something more radical, but now i'm afraid of roybot becoming like that nazi microsoft bot
all the algorithms can be confusing as fuck sometimes	btw do you know what this means?
lol	oh
not wanting to leave osu?	nah the lab
i mean and ur family right	but then the research, the many new horizons at the tips of my fingers and yet just a few mm away to properly grasp
wait but don't the grad students also go back for break	some of them are staying
so how many new horizons can u really grasp over winter break	i hope they get more funding
hurst is probably gone too	that's true ppl still celebrate christmas
it's never good to be only doing one thing for so long, sometimes u gotta step back	welp shit that might mess up the data for roybot
im still waiting for fb to prepare the download file :'(	lol yeh, this chat must be huge
damn nice selfir	yeh
wait gimme like 5 min	aight
 the video chat ended.	aha! i think i’ve found it
also adt: https://mit.universitytickets.com/w/event.aspx?id=939&p=1	yeah i think i put too much emphasis on what people create
i think sarah is going on thurday	oh shit
i feel like its meh or bad at first listen but once you start listening to them more it suddenly gets realy good	like alcohol?
🐱	🐱
its the really edgy arctic monkeys album	is it just me or has the music you’ve been listening to in general become more edgy in the last couple of years
basically once i got to arctic monkeys	you’re the most reasonable person i know
context?	lorenzo, masters student super cool dude
ppl (pretty much) would always prefer knowing what's going on over not knowing	yeh that’s true
i also am anxious and overthinkg every little social interaction lol	comparatively to the rest of us and especially what you were like before i left you seemed a lot more stable
can't go wrng lol	like your social interactions of breaking it to christina that your standards are too high 💪💪💪💪
🐱	🐱
fucking weebs	coming from the dude who sent the most recent weeb memes in this chat
they were multicultural quips	that’s what a weeb would say
i'm not a weeb your a weeb	your idea of a perfect moment would be watching sentimental ghibli films with a girl
ok but isn't the idea of that so warm and fuzzy	all the anime movies i’ve seen were by myself and 70% chance on the toilet
lol fuckinf catholics	fuck yeah it’s good
your soul mate was within you all along :')	yeh fuk dat noise
lol wtf	right?? they’re so bizarre

the boston skyline is so nice and serene	you should watch it with a girl
i stop and just stare for a while everytime i cross the bridge to get absolutely fucked up at my frat	lmao

"welp time to get wasted"	“with my frat of all dudes”

yo which side r u sitting	i’m in the middle
alex turners voice is like butter	feelsbadman
r u feeling the sad boi hrs rn	hmm, not really
eyyy nice	arms too spaghetti to feel
he has some funny escapades as a frat boi at mit lol	dude, his last words were uncanny, something along the lines of "dying is so boring, i hope i don't have to repeat it again"
*guy	right
ye	who knew more about byzantine empire history than the professors at princeton, so much so that those professors claimed it themselves
that's very specific history	and then he was diagnosed with cancer at ~50, suddenly became catholic in a bid of pascal's wager, fearful of death and god even at his last second
where r u reading from?	wikipedia and its sources to see who claimed them
nice	leonardo da vinci died in the arms of a king in very old age, nothing too tragic, except his remains have been rolled over and lost from the advanceme
why was he in the arms of a king	van gogh survived after his initial shot at suicide, while his brother, the only person who kept in contact with van gogh in the end of his life, race
do i sense some exisistential dread	i saw cathy nguyen's and her husband's video journal from wongfu about her giving birth to her daughter
woah wtf ted is 37	van gogh died in between those years of life
are phil and wes also 37?	nah, they're 3 years younger than ted
that actually puts me in some existential dread	right??
damn	but hey, ya know?
all this art history is really rubbin in huh	there's so many more lines of cocaine to snort
🐱	🐱
nvm	? what was it?
just wanted to let u know	haha, i'm pretty sure we both knew this for a while now, that's part of the structure that makes up our bond
🐱	same here, you're my best friend too
but i no homo <3 no homo u no homo bro	i feel, i need to wash off all this cocaine
🐱	lol
it knows	 you missed a call from foxy roxy.
wait whered u guys go	still parking
oh lmao	been parking for the past 20 minutes
i thought u guys were already here	you should stay your current location for sam’s sanity sake
wait lobby 7 or building 26	either one
which one is easier	we are no longer sure
damn do u guys need help parking	no iman did it lol
damn it's basically just iman	we’re trying to head to lobby 7
ok. i'm here rn	fuk dude
wdym?	i got replies like other labs could be open during the summer and stuff like that
n how u worded ur emails? i think if ur an undergrad it's a reasonable assumption for a grant organization to assume you're prospecting to do research	hey man
i think we're doing a dinner	who's we're?
botball seniors right?	oh that's right
didn't max contact you	yee
ya	fukkk
ya i got a similar thing from my pi	but wouldn't it be great to have immediate results
and a life if just research is kinda sad and lonely	hmmm, you're right once again but idk if i wanna see dat light of truth
so it's made me value slowing down and enjoying life a lot more	that's interesting, i feel like for some people it would've made them do the opposite
it makes me question sometimes how i want my life to turn out	hot damn, that took a sad turn
also ppl here are just so godamn impressive it seems unreachable sometimes	are those impressive ppl the same as the miserable ones?
at least from external observation	hmm yeh
so if i just live miserably my entire life and i create huge impact but only after i die or am old and cant enjoy it is there really a pt	i think there’s always a point if there’s always people to experience what you’ve done
bc ur dead	yeh, it’s just belief at that point
so u have to believe so strongly in yourself and your own achievements that it counterbalanced an utterly miserable life	i don’t think it counter balances anything, but rather you just believe so much in your work
even from an artist viewpoint, isn't the fantasy of creating something that everyone can enjoy and appreciate a goal from which u can derive pleasure	nah, various artists don’t even hold a similar viewpoint
aka u want to achieve that goal bc it makes u happy that it happened	some express for the sake of expression
doesn't "for the sake of expression" still mean "because i feel a drive to express things because it gives me pleasure to do so in some way"	yeh, but it doesn’t have to rely on others perceiving it, which is ironic since it means their original motivation to make the thing wouldn’t be “artf
 there are many ways to justify a goal but at it's core u wouldn't willingly pursue a goal unless some aspect of that goal have u pleasure in some way	yeh i don’t disagree with the idea that ppl do things because it makes them happy
instead i could just have a happy life that i enjoy at every moment	ahh
especially all those ppl that are super impressive at mit. then there's no way to really compete	lol i don’t think binary people are necessarily impressive
also	psshh how many nlp can there be anyway
lol wot	funding
from who?	durpa
so they do fund individuals?	nah this is something bigger
oh lol	it seems i can’t escape the military industrial complex
is it jesses thing	forever a dingo of durpa
more like derpa	nah it’ll be new since he’ll be graduated by then
oh but is it like ur own project or through sometjin else	we’ll see, there’s some more details to work out rn
ya just finished	ayyyy
it wasn't too bad cuz pnr	nioceee
not sureyet tho	ahh
i'm aoproachi g harvard bridgw	hi justin
hey ethan	wait i’m here
oh ic	that was sam
hey sam	ok so i’ll walk across the bridge
uh wait r u at the bridge rn	almost
convention center	idk where that is
🐱	idk where the line is at bu lol
i'm waiting by the harvard bridge	thanks bruh
here just meet me halfway	idk where harvard bridge lol
on mass ave	so you’ll be waiting there?
how close r u	i’m on a street
share ur location	the other reason i wanted to meet up first is cuz i’m low on battery and todays the only day i didn’t bring my laptop
look for an edgy boy leaning on an edge	i’ll sing an artic monkeys song
are u sure ur slow ass is on this bridge rn	ah shit are you on the other side
r u getting closer to my location lmao	it changed from 5 min to 8 to 5
going towards mit	ye
how tf is it taking u more than 9 minutes to cross this bridge	it says i’ve been 5 min away for 7 min
isn't that some weeb shit	lol yeh
wut	yeh same
wait y were u watching a dude sitting on a beach	nah i wasn't
i watched family movies all night	oh geezus
no homo	no homo
i'm about to sleep	oh shi
lol	nvm
wut u up to roy	nah, ernest told me to search up someone
damn wait is ernest shooting his shot	lmao idk
who dis giro	monica lee
why did ernest ask u to search her up	idk, he just said to
ah bc ur the nerdy soft boi in question	lmao, i'm a straight up fuccboi man
that song is pretty good	lmao, i only ever had it at your frat
gn	lol, sounds good, i'll be lookin' forward to it
ok gn lol	holy shit
are you watching spongebob rn	nah
at universal	yuh
damn ur finally not in ur room	there’s so many nerds here
have u seen the pretty realistic animatronics	asian girl nerds justin
the banker was pretty good	i didn’t go on any of the rides lol
lol wdym	like there were so many grown up girls that were decked out in the full robes or even cosplayed in the school uniforms
but ya there were lots of international kids	it's not cuz i looked for them! it's cuz they were 50% of the population there!
wait if it was just 50% why would that be abnormal	cuz the other 50% is like comprised of kids, parents, elders, losers like me, etc.
hmm i think its just perception bias 👀	maybe i do subconsciously actively desire a gf
psh wut kneesocks isn't even angsty	yeh but it’s indicative of a thirsty boi
oh really	i’m pretty sure kneesocks can be a kink thing
oh ye one sec	that’s the longest sec i have ever experienced lol
since a lot of electronic related measurements lie around that order of magnitude	yeh that’s true, but for some reason i expected the fundamental movements of them to be at least around a single magnitude faster
i don't think anyone should have a good judgement of molecular time lol	but there are professors and grad students that do
what are you worried about?	my scathing racism
ah me too	is it racist for one to prefer a certain race in their significant other?
tho ppl will have debates about this	i’ve seen quite a few butthurt asian boi losers mad at asian girls that favor white dudes lmao
imo	online that is, i don’t socialize with them irl
also i'm learning webdev again 😬	holy fuck
also i have some projects i wanna work on that may need webdev	what kinda godforsaken project is dat
like any project that's a website lol	it’s also important to learn at least some of ros2 😤😤😤
sorry i only learn viable things	like emacs amirite
javascript is still stupid	lol
like damn	i’ve been in this airport for the last 5 hours
it never stops	i wish there were more compatibility with emacs on windows machines so i can use matlab from emacs
bc of that beautiful beautiful autocomplete	you can customize your init.el (is that the right file? i’ve been using matlab for too long) for autocomplete! use the melpa packages
ooh wut	i got it working a couple times before i updated my system and all my files and shit broke and then it was too much of a hassle to fully restore it
i did not k dis	emacs life amirite
ready for some sadboi music	lol
🐱	are you in sad boi hours?
but u can only appreciate songs from humbug when ur in sad boi hrs	lmao sounds good
there's always reasons to be in sadbo8 hrs	maybe
lol woops i cut u off there	i said have fun wooing your sis's boyfriend
dating my sister is very different than dating any other girl	when you say it like that, it just sounds weird
lol nah i'm just saying my sis is *weird*	lmaoo aight man
if u just give off enough no homo vibes	lmao
wow i didn't k u wanted to be a girl	which is ironic, since that's what she does to me
oh lmao	"when i grow up, i wanna be a transformer"
negative her type	yeh, idk why she hangs out with me lol
who can be dragged to places more	lmao
damn dude i think katie would win this one	yeh shit man
not katie a hypothetical her lol	well shit man, let me introduce you to katie then
maybe if i say no homo enough times	you into older gamer girls, who like to stay indoors inbetween classes
honestly that's a pretty good combo	lol
nah lol	though it'll be quite the long distance
i'm not a girl	yeh tru
now i'm a 0/2	lmao
i used to be undefined	i still bet michelle would be open to a date with ya
lol def not	nah dude
yesterday she convinced me to go to boston and get dimsum/ help her do a 1000 piece puzzle	lol wut
nah with another friend as well	aw man nvm
hes also a really impressive coder / person in general	wait is emilia his gf?
except this his fatal flaw	oh wait
get that weeb shit away from me	aight mr i'm watching every ghibli film
nah his name is gilbert	and i thought you were in stalking mode
oh wait are you free tomorrow	dude i'm always free
to watch blade runner	i just happen to be napping
lol ofc	dude, i feel so relaxed now somehow
for a while	i think part of it was thinking not of "work" but just some reading i've been _wanting_ to do
lol	ha nerd
wait so r u free	yuh dude
eyy	what was it? lol
with ashley and her bf	holy shit
u k family stuff is nice to have but its also a lot sometimes	how did you get out of that
well i just got out of the night portion	yeh that’s hella lot
cuz ashley and parker are gonna do their own thing	lmaoo
ya	yeh i ain’t got any good memes for that
but hes hwite	ohhh the yu and mee thing
ye lol	maybe you’ll find a white girl who’s last name is we
or last name thei	kiera’s last name is kinda similar to that if i remember correctly
also im editing jason's college app essay	dude, lulus right
and im a little worried for him cuz every single essay is about cs	i’ve made more undergrad friends at mit than my own school
🐱	dude the plus of getting jostled from college apps is that no one will bother you about them
so they k ur the real deal	she’s into bci with physical applications lmao
er numerous years of experience, computer science, with its demand for problem solving prowess and collaboration, is what i have found most enjoyable.	yo man
🐱	lmao now i’m worried for him
"whats a thing u do just for the fun of it"	since there literally guarantee are other cs kids of his level if not higher doing a very similar thing that he is rn
i also don't wanna give him too much feedback since ts due in 2 days	i’m kinda curious though, does jason have a more innate reason behind his cs or is it more from the fact that he’s good at it and he likes it enough
🐱	no joke, do something like that
if u guys are doing rwdc	fuk i just woke up
are u and sam doing rwdc today?	looks like they all wanted to meet up today
she should be used to it by nkw	damn

🐱	but viewed from your human subjective eyes

rip	damn we’re old now
ya fuck dude	though
actually definitely so	oh, new lab emails, looks like i gotta get back to hermit mode
🐱	haven’t we always been like that
but it's a good learning experience	“i’m justin yu, i was better than everyone during my high school years, plebs”
🐱	🐱

lol	*ewin
i need to work on optimizing my data format	lmao
and lol actually i'm very curious too	and then we both add her on linkedin
dude this high school kid i met at a hackathon asked me to read over their essay	how can you further optimize a timeline of messages?
rippo	lol don’t worry too much about those high school paper publishes i learned
and realized not much has changed lol except i'm a bit less dramatic now	lol
🐱	i think i’ve been thinking about that a bit strangely recently
cya lol	gnight!
so i k to come over	will do
also u don't have to wake up super early lol	call me if it’s past something lol
billy joel's keeping me up	didn’t even realize that her classical algo can impact ml with data processing
which paper is this talking about	idk what those ml words mean exactly lol, but i’m gathering it’s with data processing
k gnight	gnight! she does not seem to have a fb profile
oh ya turns out my mom is going into town around 1 or 2 so i'll just go in then	lol shizz

oh maddie happened to be in town lol	oooohhh

i'm too socially awkward	uhhhh
🐱	 foxy roxy called you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxvid540f-i&feature=share	damn, i need better wifi
where he fights his therapist lol	yeh lol
wait are u using sams netflix account?	we used it for certain shows/weeb night
also apparently they spent an entire year just on bandersnatch	yeh seeing the hidden scenes feel rather different than just reading about them
thats pretty long for an episode of a show	yeh, but it has like hours of footage not to mention setting up the streaming platform to be a choose your adventure game
but it would be kinda cool	really?? i think there’s enough evidence to not disprove it’s existence
actually wait now that i think about it it appears everywhere	yeh right??
and its wierd that eeryone keeps just being obssessed with lions	exactly
the only consistent theme for color i could find is the red and blue pajamas he wears alternate depending on which memory of the bedroom he's in	oh shit really??
and also after he crawls through the mirror	holy crap
nope	i wish they flashed out jfd more tbh
tar because for most of the choices, no matter what you do you are basically forced to rewind until you pick a certain one the movie wants you to pick	did they not notice the changes in dialogue and scene that results through multiple loops though?
 he was giving the plyaer too much control, whereas he only needed to give them the illusion of control and the maker actually still controls the game	if i remember correctly you can enter jfd into the locked safe only if you go through a certain loop
ya but even if small details of the scenes change the overall results are forced to converge only to a few endings	yeh that’s true, the amount of branches that lead to the same ending is too much imo, making specific endings lackluster
for example no matter what you have to kill your dad/fight your dad lol	rip dad
ya	the netflix ending where the actor for stefan forgets he’s an actor is more spooky the more you think about it
in the p.a.c.s branch	what were the numbers again?
it was a combination of words that the therapist had said	ohhh
wtf	yeh right
but i never feel out of control	yeah i feel, it always feels like i choose to follow that impulse if i did
that's what pax wants u to think	lol
tbh tho would be down to have pax appear every time i'm fucked to reset me to the last time i was asleep	oh, i interpreted pax’s scenes as it’s actually real in that specific timeline/world and kills stefan
so in effect it's basically a reset	like how when he as younger stefan chooses to go with his mother, it kills another future ver of himself
even if one version of him actually dies	ah ic what you mean
ya going into the past is a little wacky, and it's not really explained why putting toy into the safe did thay	yeh, that’s the one part that’s not completely connected
his dad enters the room and suddenlt it switches to the younger versions of stefan and his dad	it’s also the only path that’s not paralleling the game
at what point did he start dreaming everything that happened up until the train death	holy shit that’s right, this path has so much more mysteries than i thought
during the acid trip	ah try
i think only in cases of trauma would ppl remember things so viscerally that we would count it as a flashback	i get crazy intense deja vus but not flashbacks lol
lol what deja vus	déjà vu (/ˌdeɪʒɑː ˈvuː, - ˈvjuː/ (about this soundlisten);[1][2] is a french term describing the feeling that one has lived through the present situat
wait so u have deja reve?	ye, deja reve
is this musky	yeh
just listen to what the girl says lol	will watch rn
🐱	debating or not whether i should go
wait please tell me ur going	perfect opportunity?
for u to make friends	“free food” on my schedule
two good things	lol
or u could just pull an enya	is that a term now?
sick meme	can’t tell if real or not
actually i shouldn't underestimate the west ciast	yeh right
:'(	i mean
ithththththththththtth	oh fuk that’s right
i'm not 100% sure if its something structurally bad with my model or if the data just isn't suitable yet	how would you make the task less challenging?
but i have limited computing resources	why not hijack a computer from a lonely unused computer lab?
its actually good	wtf so they mean by rules of robotics
what are proprioceptive force control actuators	i only had a vague idea, i didn't realize papers were published already on them
hey u actually went outside	diffeqs be wack man
wait why did you guys go piss on a mountain	i didn't
dude u can't compete against sangbae	yeh you right, dude's got like 20+ years under his belt
is this for a class or for labwork	class
my kinda shit	lyrics sound right up your alley
lol those were two very different messages	but the juxtaposition was pretty humorous amirite
lol wut	big phat text incoming
and it happens to everyone	that sentence was unintended intellectual elitism
long words like intellectual	what do you mean? that you know more than then?
so i doubt u upset her	ahhh idk, i felt like i could've been more delicate and stuff
meh	wait i'm still now concerned though
nah dude ur good	then what’s intellectual elitism like
🐱	b r u h
lol ya dw about it	wait but what exactly is this intellectual elitism
it's like how harvard has elitism	wut
for example in a physics class, u have the group of kids who are physics olympiad whizzes who laugh when ppl ask questions	lmao are they real??
sorry i feel like i'm turning all of ur rants into my own rants	nah man
for example i just took a 30 min nap and now i'm planning on working until like 5 am, then going to my urop at 9	holy shit dude
not really keep up, more like catch up	who da heck is getting the justin yu in a tizzy like this
self-esteem is a bit low but not in an unproductive way	that’s good to hear at least
no homo	no homo
aw fuck	lol
fuck	now i’m starting to question if i’m doing enough, i’m not nearly that busy lol
and i hate my health	shizzz
and tbh i've had too relaxed of a first sem	wow
ya the hourly schedule is back	i’ve barely been able to follow an hourly schedule past 6-7 pm lol
wait have classes started fo ru	yeah lol, started monday
dude lol i dont think thats a good idea	but all i do back in my dorm is school work and theory dynamics stuff in my journal
wdym by in awe	listening to talks from sangbae kim, hurst, raibert
ahem	ah, ewin tang
but also ppl like hurst and sanbae who have worked on this shit for decades, i mean i think that "glint" comes more out of time than passion	that’s where i might beg to differ, hurst has been thinking of building walking shit since undergrad
hmm i think thirsty hursty just had a fetish	🐱
i don't have that kind of learning stamina	says the guy who did that shit too
since they're a hermit	that got too real
